<h2>Glossary</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1/30th rule - The separation between the perspective of the two
images should be 1/30th the distance to the nearest subject.</li>
<li>Cha-cha - A method of taking 3d photos where you use one camera to
take two photographs, one for the left and one for the right, by
moving the camera to each location.  This can be done with a slide
bar or by just shifting your body.</li>
<li>Cross view - A stereograph where the left eye is on the right of the
image and the right eye is on the left of the image. Most people find
these photos easier to view, especially in larger sizes.</li>
<li>Dual Cameras - The use of two cameras, usually identical hardware, to
capture a both images of a stereograph at one time.  A synchronous
trigger such as hardware mods or an IR remote are often used.</li>
<li>Parallel view - A stereograph where the left eye and right eye are
presented as the world is seen naturally.  Your eyes look parallel to
each other to see the 3d image.</li>
<li>Slide bar - A tool used for increased precision when taking cha-cha
stereographs.</li>
<li>Stereo Baseline - The horizontal distance between the two images
taken, basically the distance between your eyes.</li>
<li>Stereo Camera - A camera made for taking stereo photographs, such as
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/3d/camera/finepix_real3dw1/">Fujifilm FinePix REAL 3D
W1</a></li>

<h2><strong>Loreo 3d Lens in a Cap</strong></h2>
<p>I bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.loreo.com/pages/products/loreo_3dcap.html">Loreo 3d Lens in a
Cap</a> with the
expectation that it would be a fun little toy.  Indeed it is, but it was
remarkably difficult to use with much success.  It failed with the two
feature incompatibilities of being zoomed in too tight for its stereo
base line and too limited in its near focus.</p>
<p>The perspective of the lens makes it difficult to photograph large
things without standing very far away from them.  Coupled with the
narrow baseline and the 1/30th rule this defeats the purpose of shooting
in stereo.  So, this lens doesn't work well for shooting large objects.</p>
<p>The near focus of this lens is limited to something greater than about a
meter.  This means you can't photograph things up close, there is no
macro ability.  you can photograph something like a basketball and have
good composition, but not something like an action figure because there
would be a lot of extra extra space around the subject.  Since you can't
crop the image easily it makes for compositionally poor images for small
objects.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3871828236/"><img alt="Golden Blake Bridge" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2578/3871828236_a8d91b9ff5_n.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 213px;" /></a>The result is basically a long portrait lens with
an ƒ/11 aperture.  ƒ/11 is not the best aperture for portraits with a
lot of bokeh, and if you want to have a secondary subject in the
distance you still have have to stand a long way away from it.  For
instance, this photo of Blake was taken many miles form the Golden Gate
Bridge and you still can't see both sides of it.</p>
<p>There's a rumor that Loreo is working on a lens with a wider focal
length.  This would probably solve both of the problems listed above,
and would certainly solve a least the narrow perspective.</p>
<p>Honestly I wouldn't recommend buying the Loreo because of these
limitations.  If you happen to find one for cheap or want to borrow one
that could be fun, but otherwise I'd seek out other methods for
stereoscopy like the simple cha-cha method or picking up two cheap
pocket cams or webcams.</p>
