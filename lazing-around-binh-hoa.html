		<p>On May 14 Tien and I went to the market for breakfast. Her family had
moved their shop one door down to the entryway where the food stalls
are. Hanging in their shop was a shirt that said &quot;Chicago holiday in
member recruitment we require oral interview.&quot;</p>
<p>We had a familiar breakfast there before returning to the house to play
some Wii. After lunch the power went out, and we spent the rest of the
evening playing games on the iPad, eating fruit and playing badminton in
the street behind Thu's house.</p>
<p>A lot of folks passed us on the street and gave different expressions,
from happy smiles to uninterested expression. One girl was wearing a
shirt that said &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;</p>
<p>On may 15th, like many days to come, we woke up with no power. Nhi and
Ngoc spent the morning singing You are my Sunshine and playing it on the
iPad Air Harp. It was a pretty lazy day, with a few more to come. I
thought about a video I saw on the plane that used the same phrase as
the Lonely Planet book when describing Vietnam: Life in the fast lane.
As I lay in a hammock eating cake and drinking fresh squeezed orange
juice in a house with no power I failed to find any fast lane.</p>
<p>Tien and I decided to go to LX to cool off in a cafe and surf the net
for a while. On our way we passed a man missing both legs from above his
knees. He was shuffling slowly down the side of the highway using two
blocks of wood under his thighs as a sort of shoes.</p>
<p>We went to a new cafe just off the main street. There was a No Kissing
sign by the door and a photo of GW Bush in the bathroom with his
fingertips touching his head and the text &quot;in Texas we call this a brain
sucker starving.&quot;</p>
<p>On the way home we went by an electronics shop to pick up a headphone
splitter and price a 110/220v converter to hook up the Wii and the WiFi
at the same time, but ended up not getting it because of the price.
Limited technology isn't a bad thing.</p>
<p>On the way home I saw a whole family on a motorbike. Dad was driving,
mom was cradling a sleeping child on the back and the family dog was
resting its from paws on the handlebars.</p>
<p>There was still no power when we got home. Luckily rain came and cooled
everything off.</p>
<p>Tien and I made some plans to go to a nearby beach, Ha Tien. We talked
about leaving the next morning, but instead spent the next few days
lazing around Binh Hoa playing Wii and iPad and badminton. Still can't
find that fast lane.</p>
