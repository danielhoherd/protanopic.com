		<p>Thursday morning when I woke up the first thing I did was plug in my
dead hard disk to see if it had yet another life. Luckily it did and I
put my laptop to work backing up my photos and music.</p>
<p>When Tien woke up we went next door for breakfast. I was thinking a lot
about Colorado and the fact that my brother was now out of the Army. It
had been 5 years since we'd had a family Thanksgiving together since he
joined the army just before Thanksgiving. I thought about driving
straight to CO as soon as I landed in SF, or perhaps switching my flight
to land in Denver instead. It would be nice to have a family holiday
again, though I was disappointed knowing that Tien wouldn't be there...</p>
<p>At dinner the previous night Tien and I had decided to go to Da Lat
instead of Nha Trang, and after breakfast we went to the travel agency
where I'd gotten my ticket for Cambodia and got the information we
needed to book a ticket to Da Lat. We went back to the hotel, reserved a
ticket on the bus and geeked out for a bit.</p>
<p>We were a bit late checking out of the hotel and the bus service called
saying we would miss our noon bus and would have to take the next one
leaving at 1pm. We caught a taxi and headed off down Nguyen Cu Trinh to
a bus station I'd never been to before.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the bus station, which was a small travel agency in
the middle of the city, it was 11:45. Tien talked to some guys on
motorbikes who told her we could still catch the 12 o'clock bus if the
took us there. She got on one and I got on the other and we sped off
through mid day traffic. The ride was quick with a lot of weaving and it
reminded me of the ride I took with My just before leaving Bangkok.</p>
<p>The motorbikes took us to a travel agency about 4 blocks from where we
had been staying. The problem was that we had booked a ticket with
Mailinh and this was not a Mailinh bus. Tien got into a little argument
with one of the drivers who demanded that we pay him 100,000 for the
ride, which was 4x what our taxi to the 1pm bus cost. When tien gets
upset she quits talking in English, even if I ask her to translate, so I
didn't know what was going on until after we were already on the bus,
otherwise I would've told that guy to get lost because it was not our
problem if he impersonated a Mailinh employee with the good intention of
getting us to our bus on time. I talked briefly with tien about not
clamming up on me so I can help her in situations like that, we accepted
a learned lesson and let it go.</p>
<p>The bus was nice. We took off through an area of Saigon I hadn't seen
and I decided we should rent a motorbike when we come back so we can go
explore farther. The river was cool and there were new buildings being
built. It looked more like a modern civic center.</p>
<p>I read the rest of Iron Orchid. It was a decent book but nothing
amazing. The ending wasn't all that climactic.</p>
<p>Tien began to feel motion sick because she didn't take her medicine in
time. She had some intention of staying awake on the ride and it
backfired. I felt really bad and had flashbacks to all those times I've
spent taking care of really drunk people.</p>
<p>We stopped for food briefly just before turning off of the main highway
into the hills. The terrain was immediately different in more than just
the hills. The vegetation was more thick and tough. We continued through
winding roads for a few hours and then took a longer break. Tien and I
got drinks and skipped food thinking the bus ride would soon be over.</p>
<p>Back on the road we headed into some mountains that reminded me of the
western approach of monarch pass in Colorado. The sun soon set and I
listened to Tom Waits while Tien slept. The evening silhouettes of hills
with hose and street light scattered off in the distant darkness were
familiar to me.</p>
<p>We arrived in Da Lat after 8 hours. We'd been told the ride would be 5
hours. I was hungry and tired.</p>
<p>The usual group of taxi drivers were waiting when we arrived. The first
man to approach me was dressed in quality jeans and a leather coat and a
helmet. He said he was with the easy riders and could take me anywhere.
I told him I was with Tien and VN conversation continued with a bus
driver who ended up being our local transport.</p>
<p>We were let off at a hotel and were greeted by a happy woman. Since we
hadn't arranged a driver or a hotel and had just been scammed in saigon
I was very skeptical of what was going on and was ready to walk away if
every detail wasn't good, but it ended up that every detail was fine and
so we got a large room on the second floor with breakfast included for
half of the price we had been used to paying in Saigon.</p>
<p>One of the first things we noticed once we were finally in our room was
that Da Lat was cold. Not cool, but cold. It was also raining gently.</p>
<p>We went to find some dinner and ended up at a Chinese restaurant where I
once again ordered something that I expected would have no seafood. We
weren't anywhere near the ocean, but that didn't stop the ocean gods
from frowning on my meal. I just gave the icky parts to tien and
hungrily devoured the rest.</p>
<p>Tien was really cold on the way Home so we went hat shopping. We ended
up not finding anything and just went back to the hotel. I put my
computer to work backing up the files that were on the crashing disk,
cuddled up with tien under two heavy blankets and fell fast asleep in
the cold and quiet.</p>
