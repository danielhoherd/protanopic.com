		<p>Sunday morning was warm and glorious. Eating breakfast outside was a
treat that morning. We hung around the hotel until a van came to pick us
up at 12:30 and take us off to our bus. We had expected the van to
arrive sooner and give us time to eat while waiting for the bus, but
there wasn't enough time so we boarded and headed out with the
expectation that we'd stop in an hour or so where we could find some
food. This was not the case.</p>
<p>The first place we stopped was a tea and fruit juice place that had
pretty much no food. There were a few things like cakes that you would
eat with your tea, so Tien and I got some cakes and ate them on the bus
as we headed up a mountain pass that was in the middle of being
reconstructed.</p>
<p>The bus had a DVD player and a TV at the front so people could be
entertained along the way. This was a home entertainment style DVD
player, which means it wasn't really built to handle being moved along a
bumpy dirt road winding through jungly mountains. Needless to say it
skipped a lot and they eventually turned it off. I wondered why in a
country like this with so many dirt roads a company like Mailinh who had
buses that went everywhere didn't just rip their DVDs into something
that could be played from a cheap solid state media player. I wondered
about the technological and business aspects of such a proposition,
along with my idea to put wifi at popular bus stops, since there never
is any and I'm sure people on their netbooks would use it. Perhaps the
country just isn't quite ready for that step...</p>
<p>Tien and I didn't get a chance to eat until 4:30pm. Hu tieu never tasted
so good.</p>
<p>Back on the road, I saw a motorbike with logs about 6 feet long stacked
sideways on the back seat so that it took up the full lane of the road.
The sunset was beautifully colored, like tropical fruits. There were
beautiful green rice paddies illuminated by that gorgeous dusk light,
but I had a hard time photographing it and I realized it wasn't just
because we were in a moving vehicle. Vietnam is so flat that you don't
get to see much of the beauty. Trees and lines of buildings block off so
much of the natural beauty of the rice paddies and fields, and there are
so few mountains that you rarely rise above it so you can look down on
it. It's a shame, really.</p>
<p>Well into the darkness of light we passed over a bridge where there were
house boats floating on still water, reflecting their lights all around
them. It was magical.</p>
<p>As we were coming into Saigon I saw an airplane on its descent. It was
the first airplane I had seen since we left the airport several weeks
ago.</p>
<p>I saw a huge billboard at the side of the highway advertising HHH
Zippers.</p>
<p>Back in Saigon, we caught a taxi to the Bui Phan but it was full except
the most expensive room, so we headed to the Ruby Star and got a cheap,
awesome room. WiFi on this floor was a problem, I was unable to get out
to the internet. Upon further investigation I discovered multiple
cascaded DD-WRT routers all using 192.168.1.0/24 on both their LAN and
WAN, and this was keeping me from getting out to the internet. After a
few guesses I was into the admin panel and was able to reconfigure them
each with their own LAN subnet so that there was no overlapping IP space
and I was soon able to actually get out onto the internet. I considered
different approaches but settled on this since I was doing all
configuration over the air. It was good enough for one day.</p>
<p>Monday morning I woke up and when I signed on I had some more problems
with the internet. My computer had switched to a different AP with the
same SSID and a different LAN subnet. This was no good. I decided to go
ahead and fix this problem once and for all by adding the WAN ports of
each router to the switch, disabling DHCP, giving all the APs the same
SSID and assigning them static addresses in the DSL modem. This allowed
roaming access throughout the hotel, the way it should be. It worked
like a charm and I felt pleased with having done something productive. I
rather missed the IT world and the puzzle of finding elegant answers to
technological problems.</p>
<p>Tien and I grabbed breakfast and decided that rather than stay in Saigon
and rent a motorbike, we would return to Binh Hoa. There was potential
fun in Saigon but returning home for a few days rest was appealing, and
we'd definitely be coming through Saigon again numerous times anyway.</p>
<p>The standard procedure for hotel checkout is playing on computers until
it is time to catch a taxi to a bus, then check out of the hotel and
head out. This is what we did.</p>
<p>I saw a girl on the back of a motorbike reading a book and my NV240HD
failed when I tried to take a photo of her.</p>
<p>I saw a girl with a shirt that said &quot;I swoop want water.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening we were back with the family in Binh Hoa, sharing the
details of our trip to Da Lat. The bus trip from Saigon always wears me
out because it's not comfortable and I can't relax without my body
moving into a painful position, <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4091910467/"><img alt="Scootrette" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2513/4091910467_77fee33af7_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 156px;" /></a>so after dinner and a
little bit of teaching Ngoc english from a book she had we fell fast
asleep.</p>
<p>Tuesday was pretty much a rest day. We did the routine shower and get
breakfast at the market. This morning though Thu brought over some
mangos and peeled them. They were delicious. I don't think I had ever
eaten mango before, except the dried kind. While we sat there eating
mango we planned to go hiking on Mt. Cam and to the floating market in
Can Tho. That evening we took a little ride around at sunset and took
some photos. That evening Mai made us sweet soup, which is a desert
style dish with sweet peas, coconut and some squiggly things made from
flour that have the consistency of those tapioca drinks.</p>
