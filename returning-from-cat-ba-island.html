		<p>After the previous days excursions, May 31 was a somewhat sore day. I
actually wasn't as sore as I was expecting though, which was nice. Tien
and I were thinking about finding more things to do on Cat Ba Island,
but instead we decided to head home. We chose this over our tentative
original plan, which was to take the bus back down the coast and see
things along the way. I think it was mainly because we'd been traveling
for about a week so far and were just a little tired. In hindsight, I
think we should've just taken a day to rest, but heading home wasn't a
bad choice either.</p>
<p>We grabbed breakfast and then took a stroll by the waterfront
businesses, looking for a travel agency to get us as close to her home
town as we could. We found ourselves in a travel agency with a girl
sitting in front of a piece of paper with a telephone. She talked and
talked forever, and Tien talked back. The woman made a phone call and
talked some more, then made another phone call and talked some more.
When ended up being the story was that the people on the other end of
the phone were away for lunch, and we weren't making any progress with
our flight plans. I should've known something lame was going on because
I felt that same kind of boredom I often felt as a kid in church or
school, like I'd rather die than continue sitting there doing what I was
doing.</p>
<p>Eventually we got tickets on a boat and bus to take us to Hanoi, plane
tickets would have to wait. Back at the hotel we packed, checked out and
sat down at the cafe where Paul was talking with two young brits. He
told us the story of their trip to sleep on and island. They had chosen
monkey island. They slept under a mosquito net on the beach, but got
rained on in the middle of the night. Instead of trying to sleep in the
rain, they hiked to the peak of the island in the dark to watch the
sunrise, then hiked back to where their kayaks were. Just as they were
about to leave they got attacked by a group of monkeys and had to defend
themselves with their paddles, jump into the kayaks and row away from
shore. It was quite an exciting tale, one of the best I'd heard in my
travels. The other two brits he was with were on the island with him and
they all thought it was a pretty funny, enjoyable time, monkey attacks,
rain and all.</p>
<p>We all ended up on the same boat and bus to Hanoi. The bus took us up
near where Tien and I had gone on the motorbike the first night, way off
into a marshy area with salt percolation ponds. On the way the bus
actually scraped another bus while trying to pass it on a narrow gravel
road on the side of one of the karsts. On top of that, our bus was
probably the worst automobile I've ever had to ride in. It stalled at
the top of a hill and a guy got out, I assume to put rocks behind the
wheels so they could start it and get it back into gear without it
rolling down the hill backwards. I thought about that scene from
romancing the stone where the bus breaks down and everybody on board
just gets out and starts walking. That scene had never made so much
sense to me as it did right then. The bus stalled a few more times on
the way to the boat, but we eventually got there.</p>
<p>The boat was not one of the hydrofoils or junks that we'd taken for
transit in other places. This was a boat like you'd find in America on a
lake, but longer and made for carrying people. There was an inside cabin
with rows of seats, and an outside deck with an awning and a bunch of
the ubiquitous Vietnamese plastic chairs. Paul, the british kids, Tien
and I sat on the deck with a bunch of other people, including a child
who kept pulling the hair on my leg. There was also a lot of luggage on
the deck, and a motorbike.</p>
<p>After a short ride that was always within distance of land, we arrived
in a very industrial place called Dinh Vu. Once off the boat we were
divided up into a group going to Hanoi and a group going to Ha Long
City. The bus going to Hanoi was blaring loud techno music with the
lyrics &quot;who the fuckin who the hell is ringing at the bell right now,&quot;
chosen by two slender guys in pilot shades who were in charge of that
bus. We drove through some places I had never seen, mostly industrial,
and made a bus in Hai Phong to a bigger, higher class bus.</p>
<p>Tien gets carsick depending on the quality of AC that is in the vehicles
we drive in. Sometimes she's fine, sometimes she immediately gets
nauseous. Sometimes the nausea comes on gradually with carsickness. This
bus was almost immediately nausea inducing. Actually I even got a little
bit sick. I looked it up later online and found nothing specifically
relating to AC, and it was interesting to me that the condition was so
reproducible but nothing online mentioned it. Tien sickly tried to sleep
most of the way, I played a lot of Plants vs Zombies.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4671078670/"><img alt="32::AM::142" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4043/4671078670_52de651c5e_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a>We arrived in Hanoi ahead of a storm that was making
beautiful clouds and a rainbow, and a sunset that was throwing lovely
colors at it all. Tien, the brits and I tried to get a taxi, but we
couldn't all fit and so they chose to go with Paul for a while before he
caught a bus to somewhere else. Tien and I said goodbye and took off in
our own taxi heading to Ngo Huyen street.</p>
<p>When you say goodbye to other travelers, you never know if it's the last
goodbye. We didn't see Paul again after that.</p>
<p>Tien and I went to the place we thought we'd stay but it was full. We
quickly found another place that was nice and cheap. This neighborhood
was undoubtably much better to stay in than our previous area. This was
the Pham Ngu Lao of Hanoi, the backpacker's street. Before I had started
traveling last year, Lila had told me that in every city you willfind a
place where the backpackers go. You'll be able to find cheap
accommodations, good food, good conversation, and everything you'll need
to keep traveling. She was definitely right, and we'd found that spot in
Hanoi. It felt relieving to not have to worry about all the little
things.</p>
<p>Tien and I left the hotel and went to get dinner, but two doors down we
ran into the brits. We had a funny exchange where they said they had
just gone to a noodle place, but I thought they said nude place, and had
thought &quot;damn, these kids don't waste any time partying, but where on
earth did they find a strip club in Vietnam??&quot; That was the last time we
saw them.</p>
<p>We got dinner at a place playing kung fu movies. There was a
refrigerator with a sticker that read &quot;Hybrid plasma toshiba
refrigerator.&quot; Quite the technological accomplishment.</p>
<p>After that we haggled with a travel agent for a while and ended up not
getting our tickets there. We checked the internet and found cheaper
tickets, went back out to see if we could find some cheaper around
nearby, but after talking about it over some smoothies we ended up
buying our tickets from jetstar.com. We decided to stay an extra day in
Hanoi so we could get an early flight to Saigon on June 2nd then catch a
bus back to Binh Hoa and arrive at a decent hour.</p>
