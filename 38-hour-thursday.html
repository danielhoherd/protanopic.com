		<p>Thursday morning I woke up above the Pacific Ocean somewhere off the
coast of Japan. I knew this because right after I saw the clouds and
ocean below I looked at the helpful map showing where we were on the
planet. I was given breakfast and the loudspeaker announced that we were
one hour out from Tokyo.</p>
<p>After eating I dozed some more, opening my eyes once in a while to see
what was outside my window. Blue ocean with tiny white caps under hazy
clouds. Nothing but a cloud. Picturesque rice paddies that were
unharvested and nobody and no boats in sight. Soon we were on the ground
and I was sleepily waiting in the security checkpoint line to get back
into the international terminal. I looked around at all the unfamiliar
people and heard them speaking in accents, some that I didn't recognize.
I heard a Japanese girl speaking in deliberate, clear english. I thought
about the world and how small my world had been while I was growing up,
and my world was larger than many. I still couldn't help wondering if
I'd done life a little wrong. I only traveled internationally once when
I was young, and I didn't travel much on my own volition, and usually
not to new places but back to old places. I didn't learn a second
language. As an english speaker it is difficult to chose which language
to master as your second, but that's really not an excuse because two
are better than one. The line was long and I had plenty of time to think
about these things. Getting through security was easy and they didn't
seem to care that I had a bunch of liquids that I didn't remove for
their inspection. So much of security is theater.</p>
<p>I found a little office area with wired ethernet and went to work trying
to find a way to get free internet. These guys had done their due
diligence though and I couldn't find any way around paying. This was a
problem because last time when I tried to pay I still couldn't get
online because Boingo's billing mechanism was broken. On top of that,
the Boingo software for Mac is terrible, like so many OEM apps for Mac.
They really shouldn't bother with those kinds of things and should spend
that money on something more productive.</p>
<p>I wandered around the airport, plodding along tiredly. It was familiar,
I had spent enough time here last time that I knew where I was and where
to go to get whatever. My flight wasn't listed on the display yet though
since it was too many hours away, so I just wandered aimlessly. I
exchanged some money and went to an electronics shop with some stuff
that isn't available in the USA, which is just a novelty to me but still
entertaining. When my flight did appear on the monitor I was 2 gates
down from where I needed to be, which would've been really convenient if
it weren't boarding in 8 hours. I got some tea, found a power outlet and
managed to successfully pay for internet access. This allowed me to kill
many hours of my layover while catching up on blogging and chatting with
some US folks who were up.</p>
<p>After sitting for too many hours I walked around the airport some more.
I noticed the stark differences between Japan and Vietnam. Before
landing in Tokyo I looked down at the rice paddies and it was
immediately evident that we were not in Vietnam, even though there were
rice paddies for as far as you could see. Japan was so clean, so quiet,
so organized.</p>
<p>As I was walking around looking for gifts for friends a man offered me
samples of sake, which I gladly tasted. It was delicious and I thought
about buying a bottle, but the fact that you can't even take duty free
liquids over 100ml through Japan made me wary of what other ridiculous
liquid restrictions I would encounter.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity my plane began boarding and I watched
everybody line up and get on, then when the line was nearly nothing I
boarded and took my seat. I sat next to an older Japanese woman with a
dignified demeanor. She began writing a note and when I glanced over my
eyes picked up the word &quot;unforgivable&quot;. I was curious, and although I
didn't read the whole note, I did also see that she mentioned her choice
of airlines by their reputation vs simply price. She folded the note up,
put it in an envelope and gave it to one of the flight attendants. From
then on the flight attendants would stop by from time to time and talk
and talk and talk, saying &quot;hai&quot; over and over as this woman spoke with
calm certainty. I wondered what the note actually said...</p>
<p>After watching some of Cirque Du Soleil's Dralion, which has an awesome
juggling scene, I switched to The Soloist and proceeded to be thoroughly
unimpressed. Afterwards I managed to finally get some more sleep...</p>
<p>Thursday I woke up to the ongoing sounds of a boy crying. Not wailing,
but genuinely crying. I realized it had been going on for quite a while
and wondered why his, who was seated in the next section up, didn't come
back and help him. The first thing I saw was the darkness map of the
world with our plane positioned over the pacific right on the border
between light and dark. The boy's dad eventually came back and took the
boy off to the bathroom. I closed the window shades on the two windows
next to me and went back to sleep. I couldn't stay asleep though. It was
an uncomfortable drifting in and out of sleep. Eventually we were
landing in San Francisco and as I carried my bag off into SFO I finally
woke up.</p>
<p>About 5 immigration people asked me if I had all my bags as they checked
my passport. It seemed like they couldn't believe that person could have
such little luggage. That may have been the thing that set me apart from
the rest and made them select me to a full luggage search. The guy going
through my luggage also couldn't believe that I only had one bag. He,
like the passport control officer, found it hard to believe that I
didn't have a physical mailing address. The passport control officer
scratched off &quot;San Francisco&quot; and wrote in my parents address in
Colorado Springs. The man searching my bag asked me &quot;Why did you write
down Colordo Springs if you live in San Francisco?&quot; to which I replied
that I did not write down c/s. It seems so simple, move out of
apartment, quit job, live out of a backpack, yet so many people don't
understand until they stop to think about it.</p>
<p>Sara was supposed to pick me up but I wondered if she'd even be there
after my flight was late and my time was wasted while the LEO did a half
search of my tightly and intricately packed backpack. She was though and
it was great to have a friend there to whisk me away in a sleek
automobile. We headed down 101 to Mountainview to meet up with some of
the SugarCRM crew. Pretty much the whole local IT team plus Kyung showed
up and we filled a nook in the restaurant with loud friendly
conversation. Sara had to go and I was bummed that we didn't have long
enough time to catch up with each other.</p>
<p>After lunch I caught a ride back to Sugar where Lila had brought my car.
I sat and talked a while about my travels and the way that poor
countries and technology fit together, then headed up to Lila's house to
pick up some stuff I'd left there. When I got there I took a shower,
which was great because I had been out for over 36 hours without a
shower. I also tried to take a nap but couldn't sleep, so I decided to
head on up to SF.</p>
<p>As soon as I started driving I got sleepy. Luckily I'd driven this route
a few hundred times so I could drive it comfortably while sleepy. It was
lame though, I didn't want to drive that route. I had quit my job partly
because of that drive. Between that drive and the SugarCRM HQ I felt
like my old life had been severed and I was having to pick it back up to
get to something underneath it. I just wanted to let it go and move on,
those times were gone.</p>
<p>The first place I went in SF was to my mailbox which hadn't been checked
in two months. All of the mail fit into the box, so it wasn't too bad.
The post office is right downtown SF, near embarcadero, and it was nice
to submerge myself back into the heart of SF, like jumping straight into
a pool to help you get used to the water quicker. The weather was kinda
bad, breezy with a little rain, but it was familiar and that was great.
The air was cool and clean, so different from anything I'd experienced
in the previous two months. I also heard seagulls for the first time in
two months.</p>
<p>Then as I was driving to the Sunset I witnessed the first crime I'd seen
in two months. I thought about how I hadn't felt threatened in any way
in Asia at all. The worst thing I'd encountered were animals and the
fear of getting ripped off by agreeing to an inflated price, but I
hadn't been scared of being mugged or anything while I was there. I was
sad that it took less than an hour for me to witness a crime in SF. I
love this city and honestly I don't see that much crime here, so that
was a bit of a slap.</p>
<p>Right as I was getting to Golden Gate Park I remembered the
microclimates of San Francisco, and even though it was somewhat warm
downtown it sure as hell wasn't warm by the ocean. I turned around and
drove all the way back downtown and went to my storage unit to get my
jacket and picked up some other gear while I was there, including some
camera gear I hadn't played with in a long time.</p>
<p>The ocean was vibrant and the horizon had a crisp line as I drove to
Java Beach to get coffee and internet. I didn't stay long because Rob
told me to meet him at Noriega Pizza, so I headed down there. We talked
a little bit and it was good to see a great friend, but I had a hard
time saying a lot of stuff about my trip because I still need time to
process it. Maybe... maybe this is as good as it'll get and I should
just blab about it without thinking too hard. At any rate we had good
convo and then headed to Sea Biscuit to meet up with Rob Taylor so they
could record a podcast for (d)NOT.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's just the fact that I can understand the language,
but I think that San Francisco has more doers than other countries I've
visited. Aside from Rob and Rob recording their gig in a coffee shop
with friendly and familiar folks walking in and out catching up with the
latest goings on, I've seen a lot of other people around already that
look like they're up to something fun. There is a cool energy in San
Francisco that I really really like. Some of it is the natural energy of
the city, and on top of that there is the sentimental aspect, the
familiar places with so many good memories tied to them. I was really
really happy to be back.</p>
<p>We dropped Rob Taylor off at home and headed back to Rob's place and
geeked out with laptops, linux, Star Trek and a sip of whiskey.</p>
