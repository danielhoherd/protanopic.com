		<p>As I finished my whiskey the flight to Saigon began boarding, so with
Kaskade in my ears I took my seat. I gave up the music for some more
Jack Kerouac, which I'm really enjoying. My aunt recommended &quot;On the
Road&quot; to me, and Rob had gotten it for me as a going away present.</p>
<p>On my VN flights there has been a view from the cockpit of the runway
displayed on all of the video displays during take off and landing. It's
pretty neat and I'd never seen that sort of thing before.</p>
<p>I wondered how many miles I had traveled so far. It's too bad there's
not a tool to go through my flickr page, order by date and create a
rough estimate of distance traveled.</p>
<p>The controller for the entertainment system on this plane was labeled on
the back as an &quot;Enhanced Passenger Control Unit.&quot; I had to laugh at
that, envisioning myself being controlled through some enhanced method.</p>
<p>After reading several pages, which is about how much I tend to digest of
books at a time, I put it down and turned the music back on. I had
beautiful, inspiring music in my ears and outside of my window were huge
billowing clouds, some of the most beautiful clouds I've ever seen. I
took some photos with my iPhone but they came out pretty bad. The motion
of passing them was also part of their wonder. I became really inspired
and began dreaming about the future... what I would do with my future,
where I would go. My mind kept wandering away from my trip to Cambodia
and so on, I was dreaming about a girl instead.</p>
<p>I was deep in the zone. &quot;The Zone&quot; is one of those things you have to
experience to know exactly what it is. Some call it The Ether. I was
having great dreams of great things and a great life. There are people
that dream great things and let them go, and there are those of us who
dream great things and make them happen. I had dreamed about quitting my
job, selling my things and flying away to Asia and I made it happen. Now
I was having new great dreams and I wanted to make them happen...</p>
<p>I landed in Saigon, only the name of a hotel in a note on my iPhone.
Walking out to the front of the airport I thought Tien might be there
waiting for me, so I stood by the window and looked for a while. I
didn't see her, so I went outside and found a taxi driver who said he
knew where the hotel was and we headed out.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3620695325/"><img alt="Commuting family" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3598/3620695325_96c4e731e8_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>Rush hour traffic was nuts, I've never seen traffic
so chaotic, so packed. People were driving their scooters on the
sidewalks through the park just to get around the gridlock. A man on a
scooter ran into the back of another scooter and knocked her over.
People were intentionally driving the wrong way down one way streets to
get closer to where they were going. We drove down tiny one lane alleys
with scooters coming at us and passing us. One of them hit the mirror of
the taxi and knocked it inwards.</p>
<p>It took us a long time to get a short distance, but my taxi driver was
on top of stuff and got us to the neighborhood quicker than others
would've. The problem was that when we got there he didn't know where
the hotel was. We had a minor argument in broken english and written
amounts of money and he dropped me off at the Ruby Star hotel.</p>
<p>The Ruby Star ended up being a good choice. The staff was nice, the
woman at the counter spoke english, there was WiFi in my room, a stocked
fridge, and it was a block away from where all the backpackers were
staying. I stayed in for the night, catching up with friends and
checking e-mail, facebook and flickr. I chatted with Tien and she said
she was in fact in Saigon and had intended to meet me at the airport,
but traffic had been so bad she couldn't make it. I was happy that she
had even tried, and more so that she was there in Saigon. We agreed to
meet at my hotel the next morning at 8am.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4496474116/"><img alt="Taking one last call" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4052/4496474116_1f1a515071_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>She showed up right on time and we headed out
for breakfast and to see what was nearby. Breakfast was good food and
good company and good conversation. I was happy as could be to have her
back, I'd missed her a lot on my trip and was sad that she couldn't go,
especially since she'd spent so much time setting the whole thing up. I
thought about the dreams I'd had the day before and was happy. We talked
about life and traveling and I don't really remember what else...</p>
<p>Then we went and got lost in the city trying to find a book store. We
didn't really get lost in the city as much as lost from the bookstore.
People kept telling us to go different ways, and then when we found the
bookstore it was closed so we had to find a different one. We finally
found the other one and it was quite a ways away from the hotel,
especially given the late morning sunlight beating down on us.</p>
<p>The book store was cool inside. We found some ESL books for her to use
in teaching her neighbor. There were a lot of books, many of them with
incorrect info about customs, typos, etc.. I found two that looked good
though, things that I'd use if I were teaching english. We looked for
another book to use that would teach small business conversation. I
picked up one that had silhouettes of business people with one man
talking on his cell phone and no words on the cover in English.</p>
<p>To my surprise, when I opened it up the entire book was all about
graphic sexual things. There were diagrams of body parts and
translations for things like exhibitionism, bondage and masochist. I
flipped through it and sure enough, it was not at all about business and
entirely about sex. I thought for a minute about buying it for my
friends in San Francisco as a joke, but I thought the novelty of it was
only worthy of a story and not of the book itself.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese girl spoke to me in very clear English, I was impressed
with her pronunciation. Like all conversations with white people in
Vietnam, she started out by asking where I was from. Then she went on to
ask me why on earth the word &quot;bad&quot; meant &quot;really awesome.&quot; Aside from
using Michael Jackson as an example, I explained to her that Americans
use a lot of negative things as slang to mean &quot;really awesome.&quot; Phrases
like the bomb, the shit, dope. It never occurred to me that this is how
it worked until that moment. She looked so inquisitive, like she
couldn't possibly comprehend why on earth we would do such a thing.</p>
<p>Then she asked if Tien was my friend. Tien thinks that everybody looks
at she and I because she's so short and I'm so tall next to her. I think
this is partly true, but people stare at me all the time anyway.</p>
<p>We went out and got some strawberry smoothies to cool off. Even in
mid-day heat in Saigon you can still get brain freeze from drinking a
smoothie too quickly.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/5825337712/"><img alt="Left Turn" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2798/5825337712_b73899db54_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>We walked and walked and walked and got sorta lost and
found our way back near the hotel. I was a little irritated with how
loud the city was, how smoggy it was, and how hot it was. Saigon is an
ubiquitously noisy city. There's nowhere you can go that isn't noisy.
This noise is created mostly by scooters, and thus there is almost
nowhere you can go where it isn't smoggy.</p>
<p>I found a park looking area at a central bus stop and found some shade
on a short wall under a tree for us to sit in for a while. Tien began
talking about sad things... about how she had missed me and how our
cultures were different and how we could only be friends and she was
going to have to accept that. I've regarded her as a girlfriend, so this
was disheartening, and I didn't feel like leaving it at that since I
knew she was giving up.</p>
<p>I asked her about what she would have if she could have it her way. If
things could be great, how would they be? What were here great dreams?
She didn't want to tell me, so I told her I'd tell her my great dream if
she told me hers.</p>
<p>She said she wanted to be a pharmacologist, which is true and is great
but wasn't related to what we were talking about.</p>
<p>She said she wanted to be with me, to travel around the world with me.</p>
<p>I told her my great dream that I couldn't get off my mind. The great
dream that had been growing in me for a long time and had blossomed on
the plane from Hanoi.</p>
<p>I asked her to marry me and to come back to San Francisco with me.</p>
<p>I told her that whenever I thought about the future of my travels I
quickly ended up on thoughts of her and I traveling and discovering
great things together. I told her that all of the great things I thought
about for the future somehow ended up with her. I told her that we had
an opportunity to have a great, amazing life together, in love, seeing
the world, enjoying each other side by side from now on.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3622502414/"><img alt="Tien and I" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3622502414_637f2c5dcd_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>There was some confusion and reiteration and assuring her
that I was serious and not just speaking hypothetically.</p>
<p>It was not traditional, it was not a Hallmark card. There in the mid-day
heat on a little wall under the shade of a tree in that crummy park at
the bus station surrounded by construction and oceans of noisy,
polluting scooters in the middle of Saigon, without a ring but without
any hesitation or doubts, with just a shared dream of being happy
together I asked Tien to marry me and she said yes.</p>
