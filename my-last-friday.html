		<p>Today I headed out from work up to Lila's house to drop off some photos
and pick up some stuff I had left up there. On the way up to SF to meet
Rob and Donna for dinner I stopped to take some photos of the clouds
spilling over the mountain range into the valley. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3556299906/"><img alt="Foothills Park Sunset" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3368/3556299906_24313f1887_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>This is something I see frequently, but haven't ever captured
the way I'd like to.</p>
<p>I got to SF and Rob was out front of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/eliza-restaurant-san-francisco">Eliza's</a>
smoking a cigar. The driver of Donna's bus kicked everybody off so he
could go to the bus depot, so she was a little late. Rob and I went into
a bar on the corner to kill time. It just so happened that this bar had
Singapore Slings on the menu, so in gonzo style, and in honor of my trip
to Asia, we ordered two of them. Neither of us had ever had one, and
they were pretty tasty.</p>
<p>Donna showed up just in time for us to finish so we popped next door and
had a ƒ amazing Chinese meal. Eliza's has the best hot and sour soup
ever. Seriously. It's really really good.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we had picked Eliza's is because it was near a venue
we were going to catch a show at later. Some folks that Rob knows online
from MN were performing at the Retox Lounge. One for the Team was the
name of the band, and we got there in time to catch a few of their
songs. Incidentally they are headed to Colorado Springs, so if you're in
the area keep an eye out for them.</p>
<p>There was also a girl there giving peanut butter cookies away. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3556262020/"><img alt="Bad Boys on fire" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2460/3556262020_7f47528b84_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>Rob had seen her at the Phenomonauts show where she was also
giving cookies away. She said that she always brings baked goods for the
band and fans of the shows she goes to. She also said that this was her
second time at Retox. The first time she saw a band perform there they
had a lead singer dressed in a suit made from dildos and band members
who were all wearing diapers. Her cookies were delicious.</p>
<p>The band coming up after them was a psychobilly band that Rob had seen a
few times, Bad Men. They were really awesome. Talented musicians, good
vibe, and to top it off they lit their instruments on fire for the last
song. How the hell can you top that? Accordingly, we left shortly after
their set was over.</p>
<p>On the way back to 4211 I didn't make a single wrong turn. For the first
time ever. Just in time for me to leave town.</p>
