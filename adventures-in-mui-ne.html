		<p>I dreamed about Sarah Palin doing art projects for President Obama while
he was busy running all over Washington DC trying to escape the secret
service because they were holding him back from doing the things he
wanted to do. I woke up with Doe-A-Dear stuck in my head.</p>
<p>I went to take a shower, and upon increasing the &quot;heat&quot; dial on the
electric hot water heater that was attached to the shower, the light in
the bathroom flickered and went out. In the pitch black with my hand
still on the dial, I decreased the temp and the light flickered back on.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4119793574/"><img alt="Fishing Boat" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2695/4119793574_803b5b8d37_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> After showering I got dressed I poked my head out the
front door of our room and some mysteries from the previous night were
unraveled. Beyond some local fishermen taking their nets out of the
circular boats and emptying them there were many boats anchored not far
out in the ocean. Two guys on a motorbike rode down the beach and parked
near the fishermen. I wanted to ride a motorcycle on the beach.</p>
<p>Tien and I went to get breakfast, which was supposed to be included in
the price of our hotel. On the way we passed some older Vietnamese men
with a lot of missing teeth who were drinking beer and eating crabs for
their breakfast. We also saw some chained up monkeys, a golden lizard
that I was not familiar with, and a dozen small dogs. We found our way
to the large dining area of the hotel restaurant. It was an open walled
lodge type of building with a tall peaked roof and only one of the 50 or
so tables was occupied.</p>
<p>The owner of the resort interrupted our conversation to sit with us
while we were waiting for breakfast. He had much the same character as
the sleazy guy on the bus the previous night and the guy we stayed with
in Binh Duong. Later Tien and I would talk about how many of the
Vietnamese men who go to America and come back have this very haughty
attitude, and she would express her hopes of not becoming like that.</p>
<p>The bread was stale, the food was bland, and the price was not included
with our room. Bien Nam was probably the worst deal I've ever gotten on
a room, and I do not recommend it to anybody who is going to Mui Ne.
With that in mind we went for a walk on the beach which we now saw was
home to many other hotels. We walked along the beach, stopping at each
to inquire about vacancy, price, wifi and to see a room. There were
varying qualities of hotels and we settled on one that had wifi in the
lobby, a friendly staff, a much cleaner room, a halfway decent view of
the ocean, and for 25% less per night.</p>
<p>As we were walking along the beach there were numerous jet ski's parked
on the shore. I hadn't seen a jet ski in Asia except on the river in
Thailand, and wondered why because they're so speedy and nimble, the
aquatic equivalent of the ubiquitous motorbike. Here they were on the
Pacific Ocean being used for entertainment.</p>
<p>We checked out of our old hotel without so much as a word from the owner
asking us why we were leaving or asking us to stay and I thought that he
was probably used to having one-night guests. We checked into our new
hotel and took a nap. Tien was sleepy, but I was not, so after a few
minutes of restless napping I got up and shaved my face and head.</p>
<p>When Tien finally got up we were both pretty hungry, so we decided to go
to town. We stopped by the lobby to return our key and I played on their
wifi just enough to discover that they had a wireless with no connection
to the internet.</p>
<p>We went out front to try to wave down somebody to give us a ride into
town. Not many people were passing by, and most already had passengers,
so I thought we might as well walk down the road while trying to hitch a
ride. It was remarkable though that I had been asked innumerable times
before if I needed a motorbike when I did not, and here I was without
one in sight. It wasn't like Malaysia either where a taxi mysteriously
appeared from behind a building just when we needed it.</p>
<p>We walked for a while and found some guys sitting in front of a hotel
with some motorbikes there. Tien talked to one of them and he said he
could find another person so we could both ride into town for 25k each.
Just after he left to go find another motorbike rider willing to give us
a ride, the valet told Tien that we could probably rent a motorbike for
the day for not much more than 50k. A second man on a motorbike came by,
then the first man came back with a third guy on a motorbike and what
ensued was a long bickering argument about how we needed to rent from
the guys we first spoke to even though they were not going to allow me
to ride their bike, which was something we wanted. In the end I said
&quot;fuck it&quot; and we left the three stubborn motorcyclists there and started
walking down the road again.</p>
<p>We walked for a while and it was actually pretty nice to use my body,
something I'm so used to doing in the USA but don't get much chance to
here in Asia. There were beautiful trees with flowering leaves, and the
ocean was visible through a thin line of trees between the road and the
beach. Eventually the second motorcyclist from the argument came up to
us on the road, talked to Tien for a while and we agreed to rent his
bike for a day for 180k. I'd never driven a manual without a clutch
though, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do so without first watching
Tien. As soon as she took off down the road I realized that it was just
like riding an auto except you could kick a pedal to change gears
without worrying about the clutch.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4119793578/"><img alt="Flat Tire in Mui Ne" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2657/4119793578_9b79270290_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a>Renting the bike was a great idea. We were now
cruising down Highway 1 of Vietnam right by the ocean with warm air on
our face on our way to find food for our hungry bellies. We passed a
herd of water buffalo and a bunch of people who were drying fish on
screens and then found ourselves at a dead end. We were lost again.</p>
<p>We wandered around some coastal villages, finding several dead ends, and
were just about to make some progress on finding our way to town when we
got a flat tire. Obviously this was incredibly lame since I was hungry
and it wasn't our bike anyway, but at least there was a moto shop right
there where we had it repaired within 30 minutes. We had to buy a new
tube and kept the old one as well as the contact information of the shop
who did the work. I also took some photographs, but mainly because
that's what I do.</p>
<p>With our new tire and some instructions on how to get to town, we headed
off still in search of food for our bellies. I honestly was beyond the
point of hungry and didn't care much anymore, though I knew I should
eat. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4118095459/"><img alt="Mui Ne Palms" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2633/4118095459_9187c931c8_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>We rode and rode and rode. We saw a lot of cool
things, like the harbor where most of the boats anchor, some cool
buildings, forests, animals, but amazingly we couldn't find a
restaurant. We passed all the way through town and out to where the
sizzler was, though we never did find that, and all we saw along the way
were cafes with snacks, but no real food.</p>
<p>We found a sign for The Mui Ne Easy Riders that said &quot;I'll show things
the lonely planet did not.&quot; I thought that was awesome, and it was
accompanied with pictures of Vietnamese bikers on proper motorcycles
geared up with luggage and white people on the back.</p>
<p>We went all the way back through town and found ourselves lost at the
first dead end we had found, which was a kite surfing camp.</p>
<p>Finally we gave up and went to get some gasoline and as dumb luck would
have it, we found a restaurant. Too tired and frustrated to show our
joy, we pulled over, ordered some food and drinks, and were promptly
attacked by about 50 flies. I'd never seen a place with so many flies. I
ordered a beer and the man went and pulled the bottle out of a crate of
empty bottles, a hat, a helmet and other miscellaneous things. When I
was done with my beer I set the glass down there were like 15 flies
crawling all over it within 30 seconds. It was probably due to all the
dead fish, since we were in a fishing village. We got our food to go
because the flies were too much.</p>
<p>On the way back to the hotel we stopped to get a hot dog, which is not
the same as it is in America. In Vietnam a hot dog is some kind of
triangular crepe thing with no meat in it. We took a different route
home and found ourselves riding along a big field of sand and trees
where kids were jumping into the sand the same way I did when I was
their age. We found our way up the big roads and vacant round-a-bout
from the night before and were soon cruising that beautiful section of
the coast again. The day was beautiful, the ocean was beautiful, I had
my fiancé with me, I had hot food to put in my belly, and we weren't
lost. I was happy. So happy I had Tien stop so I could take her photo.
As I was composing my shot a used trash bag blew up against my leg.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4112447186/"><img alt="Cruising Highway 1, Vietnam" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2734/4112447186_d04b0a3863_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> Back at the hotel we sat on our bed and
watched the ocean beyond the tin roof cabana where nobody was sitting.
Since it was so late, just about sunset, the heat had worn off, so we
decided to go back to the sand dune park nearby and have a look around.</p>
<p>Children greeted us with sleds for rent to slide down the sand dunes. We
valeted the bike and started hiking up the dunes. Two kids followed us
trying to rent us a sled for 30k, which we were not interested in. There
were a lot of other people there watching the sunset, even many white
people. I always try to smile and nod a greeting to other travelers as I
pass them if it's appropriate, and it always amazes me how white people
don't want to talk to each other or acknowledge each other's existence.</p>
<p>Before heading home we got some snacks and a deck of cards. Back at the
hotel the internet was still down and they didn't know why. I knew why
though. It was misconfigured and was getting no responses to its DHCP
queries. It probably needed PPPoE, but those settings were not
remembered in the firmware, which means it may have been hard reset as a
last ditch attempt to fix what is probably an unreliable DSL connection.
I hate DSL.</p>
<p>Back in the hotel room Tien washed our clothes and we hung them to dry
on a rope that I brought to use for just such an occasion, then I taught
her how to play a card game that I know but don't know what it's called.</p>
