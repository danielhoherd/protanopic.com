		<p>Hanoi was immediately recognizable as a more modern city than the rest
what I've seen of Vietnam. There were many cars on the streets, there
were less shanty shacks and more tall buildings, there were large
bridges, a railroad, cleaner streets. There were mountains visible in
the near distance and I liked it immediately. There was a lot of water,
big bodies of water like lakes and wide rivers. There were people
hanging around parks, having picnics, fishing from the shore wall,
parked with their scooters under shady trees, and I thought that this
would be a very fun city to live in. There are less mosquitoes and less
geckos.</p>
<p>The building architecture here is as impressive as Saigon, only there's
more of it since there are less shacks. I would love to come back some
day with a guide and a tilt/shift lens and do a whole book on the
architecture of Vietnam. The lines are so clean, the space is more... I
don't know how to describe it... less monotonous than even the
Victorians of San Francisco, which I love.</p>
<p>Another thing I noticed about Hanoi is there was art. Art had been
mostly absent on my journey so far, except mass media like TV and ads
which aren't a direct expression of the local people. Other than
architecture there have been only small examples of art. Thu's manicure
paintings which she had samples of. A man with a flute, a man with a
guitar. Tien singing. But here in Hanoi, art is prominent. There are
tiled mosaics along boulevards, many Chinese influenced decorations, and
martial arts as well, but I'll get to that later.</p>
<p>The Hanoi tour started at the airport with a family of 8 and an older
Vietnamese couple from France. I was the only white person, the only
English speaker except our guide. He told me that we were going to pick
up two more people then head out for some sights. We found our way to a
hotel and found our two other people, a Vietnamese man in his 20's and
his wife, a drop-dead gorgeous, beautiful Vietnamese girl with a figure
that could start wars.</p>
<p>We drove on and came upon an old school of eastern philosophy. Around
the outside of the school walls there were men with mirrors hanging off
of trees or the wall itself giving people haircuts on the sidewalk.
Inside the school there were Vietnamese, French and English translations
of plaques describing what the school was about, but all of the original
text was in traditional Chinese. I hadn't been aware of the heavy
Chinese influence in Vietnamese culture until I came to Vietnam, but
it's everywhere.</p>
<p>We went on to have lunch and I was seated at the end of one table. Next
to me were the man and his beautiful wife, and to my surprise he greeted
me in English. I asked him about it and he said he didn't speak English
fluently, but had been living in Florida with his wife for several
years. Then she began speaking to me in perfect English. She was a
Vietnamese American, born in the south of Vietnam and raised in Miami.
She wondered why on earth I joined a tour without a translator and I
thought about Tien.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549990/"><img alt="View from Hanoi hotel room" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3563/3610549990_a1422c1f7a_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a> After lunch we went to the hotel. I got my
key and went to my room on the second floor and discovered why this tour
might have been more expensive than I had thought. This room was nice.
It had a refrigerator in it. The refrigerator had beer and coke and
bottled water in it. There was a bath tub with warm running water. There
was air conditioning, but it didn't seem to be working. In fact nothing
electronic except the refrigerator seemed to be working.</p>
<p>I later found out that they have this ingenious mechanism in this hotel
where all non-essential electronics are hooked to one circuit and all
essential electronics are hooked to another. When you enter the room you
insert the room key into a little slot and this turns on the
non-essential circuit. When you leave you take your key and all of the
lights, TV, fan, etc. turn off. I imagine this is pretty important in a
city where the power lines are in such atrocious conditions. I even saw
a a power junction pole on fire yesterday.</p>
<p>I didn't know this about the electricity yet though, but that did not
stop me from cracking open a Tiger beer, running a hot bath and relaxing
in the tub under the light of a LED flashlight that Igor bought for me
before I left. It was wonderful. I hadn't had a beer or a bath since
before leaving America a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>The tour continued at 4pm and we went to another pagoda with a shrine
inside of it. There are shrines everywhere around here. In Binh Hoa I
saw something that looked like a doghouse, but really it was a small
shrine.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549992/"><img alt="Pagoda in Hanoi" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/3610549992_b9babe2a14_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 158px;" /></a> We had dinner on the waterfront at a good restaurant,
a modern restaurant, and there was a wedding reception going on. I saw
the first Mercedes Benz since I'd been in VN. I walked along the shore
wall and found several dead fish floating in the water and was glad I
didn't see this before dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner we went back to the hotel and I was thinking about going
out on the town for a while. Hanoi is rad and I really wanted to go out
and see more of it on my own, but alas the lack of good sleep caught up
to me and I drifted off on the king sized bed and slept for nearly 10
hours.</p>
<p>When I awoke at 5am the sun was already up beyond the trees and
buildings and morning light was diffusing off the sky into the park
across the street where 50 or so people were doing thai chi or some
such. I took a shower, took some photos of the building, organized my
backpack a little, and looked outside again to see even more people in
the park. They were playing badmitton on the sidewalk, doing martial
arts, thai chi, and dancing. What an interesting place Hanoi is... I
hope to come back some day.</p>
<p>In 30 minutes we will leave for Ha Long bay, which is ~200km away.</p>
<p>I still haven't found free WiFi in Vietnam.</p>
