		<p>Friday, Nov 20th, I woke early to a very rainy and stormy morning.
Having less than a week left I decided to go ahead and figure out my
plan for when I arrived back in America. Some of my friends were online
since it was evening in the USA, and I figured out that I'd spend a few
days in SF and then drive to CO just after Thanksgiving to spend some
time with my family.</p>
<p>Tien was sleeping while I figured all of this out, and I was touched
with a magic that so many other people in history have been touched
with, that of being simply alive and doing normal activities while their
love slept next to them, peaceful and in their own little dream world.
It is a great joy being able to unobtrusively observe a peace that is
completely independent from yourself. It's almost like a third person
perspective on your own joy, because that person is such a part of the
happy parts of your own life but at that moment they are detached from
the waking realities, such as being ill while on a stormy weathered
vacation.</p>
<p>I did some research online and figured that I probably had strep throat,
or a number of other more terrible things. The medicines I had been
taking were mostly ineffective, but not entirely. At least I had been
taking the recommended pain reliever, tylenol.</p>
<p>We had pho for breakfast at our dark alley pho place, which wasn't so
dark during daylight, and decided to go ahead and go to the Vinpearl
since we wanted to do something wonderful on this otherwise ruined trip
to Nha Trang. We went back to the hotel to pack up some things to take
and instead of going we fell asleep. When I woke up I had a fever of
probably about 102, which was just a guess compared to a measurement we
would take after getting a thermometer.</p>
<p>I got online and told my bother about my sickness. Tien and I had
managed to take a decent photograph of my throat and I sent it to him.
Having been a medic in the Army stationed in Iraq he had seen plenty of
sore throats. He took one look at the photo and recommended penicillin
saying it was probably strep throat. The diagnosis was inconclusive
without a lab test, but he said that no matter what I was diagnosed with
they would put me on penicillin, so it didn't really matter what I had.</p>
<p>I sent Tien down to the local pharmacy to get some meds and she managed
to score some penicillin, which apparently is not a prescription drug in
Vietnam. She also got some of other recommended medicine and a
thermometer that we used to verify my fever. Needless to say we did not
go to the Vinpearl and instead spent the evening inside with Tien quiet
and worrying about me. I kept trying to make jokes and talk while she
was caring for me but she thought I was delirious from my fever and just
worried even more.</p>
<p>Eventually we both went to sleep, but having slept most of the day I was
unable to sleep the whole night. I woke up at 2:45 and couldn't sleep. I
took some more meds and found my temperature to be 100. I stayed up for
about an hour playing on my computer before I managed to become tired
enough to get back to sleep. Tien later told me that she had drifted
into consciousness and had seen me playing on the computer, but thought
it was a dream and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>When I woke up the next morning it was 8am and I had no fever. After
breakfast we figured out our travel plans to return to Saigon and spent
the rest of the morning waiting for the train in our hotel room watching
Terminator. Tien had never seen it before and she was pretty intrigued
by it. I didn't go into the fact that the robot who had traveled back in
time to kill this woman was also the person who was running the state of
California where she would be living within a year.</p>
<p>When we were checking out of our hotel the woman at the front desk
chatted with us a bit and asked me to bring a man back from America for
her. I chuckled, half out of politeness and half out of amusement that
so many people in Vietnam say things like that.</p>
<p>We took a taxi to the train station and found that the train was delayed
over an hour. There wasn't much to do or eat at the train station so we
wandered down the street carrying our bags and found a restaurant that
looked good but ended up being pretty awful. I longed for yelp.vn so I
could write a bad review of the place.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4124076905/"><img alt="Blue Train in Nha Trang" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2704/4124076905_717272aae1_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>We returned to the train station and waited
some more. I went to use the bathroom and the mens room was unavailable.
The women's room had no light and there was a lot of liquid on the
floor, and who knows what else since it was dark.</p>
<p>When we finally got on the train the first thing I noticed was that it
was pretty dirty. The seats were also pretty run down and rickety, but
were actually pretty comfortable. Once we started rolling it was great
though, so much more enjoyable than the bus. We didn't get many great
vistas, but we did pass a lot of beautiful landscape that I would love
to photograph. Some of the landscape looked like jungle, but there were
also mountains with rocks that reminded me of Colorado and Wyoming.</p>
<p>We played cards for a long time and listened to music. There was also
the standard television entertainment. I saw an ad for a slim TV that
was only like 18&quot; thick and was amused. A few weeks later I would go to
a best buy with Dan Fava and find a television that was less than 2&quot;
thick.</p>
<p>We rolled slowly into Saigon that night and got a new view of city life
from the window of that train passing behind buildings, looking into
bars and apartments and restaurants that we hadn't seen before. I wished
I had a camera that was better at photographing in darkness because
there were some really awesome scenes visible from that window.</p>
<p>Tired from our travels, we did the usual routine of finding a taxi to
drop us off at the Ruby Star.</p>
