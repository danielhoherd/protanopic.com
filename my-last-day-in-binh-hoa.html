		<p>On Nov 22nd we woke up in the familiar Ruby Star, pretty much a third
home by this time. My stomach was a little bit upset, probably from the
meds, but it was better than the alternative.</p>
<p>The last time we were in town I had seen a building I wanted to check
out that looked like a great vantage point to take photographs from. We
went out after breakfast and wandered around the streets looking for it.
We never ended up finding it though. I had really wanted to take some
tilt/shift photos from the top of it, which looked like it might be a
restaurant.</p>
<p>That afternoon we caught a bus back to Binh Hoa and managed to score the
front seat for once. I enjoyed the ride and the change of perspective
from the typical bus rides we get where we have to sit in the back. I
thought back to my first bus trip to Binh Hoa which was in the middle of
the night. The roads were winding and bumpy with lots of short uphills
and downhills. I had thought this was us driving through mountains, but
this time I could clearly see in the daylight that it was just bridges
over rivers and there were no mountains in sight.</p>
<p>That evening I felt like I may be having some unreasonable side effects
from the medicine and so I decided to go off of them. This was a great
opportunity for me to finish some wine that Tien's family wouldn't be
able to, and that put me into a deep deep sleep that night.</p>
<p>The next day was a lazy day spent in Tien's village. That evening we
went out and cruised around the city with her sisters while they were
shopping for some stuff. Tien and I spent a lot of time waiting for them
to finish what they were doing. We occupied ourselves by looking for
cool things to photograph and ended up down by the river. A little while
later we met up with her sisters and we all went to eat dinner by the
river. I got eaten alive by mosquitoes and the food was only OK. I was
in a funk from that, the general mood of the evening and the fact that
I'd be leaving the next day. I wished that something would be different,
that we wouldn't be spending the last evening waiting and riding around
Long Xuyen on a scooter killing idle time. That's how it was though, and
after dinner we went home to Binh Hoa for my last night in the Mekong on
this trip.</p>
