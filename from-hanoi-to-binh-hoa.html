		<p>Because our flight had been changed and was no leaving that night, we
had another day to kill, so we took no care to wake up early on June
2nd. Tien was craving bao cake so we went and got that for breakfast,
and of course coffee. While we were lounging around wasting the morning
that we had hoped to be traveling, I got another disappointing e-mail,
this time from the Consulate in Saigon. It said they were raising the
prices of the visa application from $131 to $350 taking effect 8
business days before Tien's interview. At least it wasn't worse, saying
they were no longer taking interviews or something like that.</p>
<p>We checked out, walked around and hired a bus to take us to the airport
later, then went back to the ol' Quintessence of Hanoian. It was a nice,
cool day, perfect weather. Overcast enough to keep the temperature cool,
but still bright enough that it wasn't gloomy, with a cool breeze to
keep the air fresh. Perfect weather to while away a spare day drinking
coffee by the historic lake that Tien used to dream about as a girl.
Unfortunately we had too much time, and that cafe had no wireless, so we
went to find another place to stay. We found ourselves at the best ice
cream shop I've ever been to. Fanny Ice Cream. If you're ever in Hanoi,
go there. It's amazing. They don't have food though, but somehow Tien
and I managed to stay there for hours surfing the net, eating ice cream
and drinking fruit juice. The food part as a poor decision because we
ended up not being able to get food before it was time to leave for the
airport.</p>
<p>Traffic on the way to the airport was typical Hanoi traffic, too many
cars on narrow roads. There was an accident with a car and a moto, and
one with a bus and a cow. I actually enjoy sitting in Hanoi traffic
though because looking at the scenery is fun. The architecture is great,
and for some reason the whole city is just eye catching to me. If Tien
and I ever have to move there for work or something, I will not be
disappointed.</p>
<p>We finally got a chance to eat after checking into our flight, then we
went inside the secure area to wait for our plane. I decided to stand
since I'd been sitting most of the day, and it was interesting to see
what everybody was up to. I saw a man with a bright duffel bag full of
souvenirs, and it suddenly dawned on me that the tourist people on my
first trip to Hanoi who had given me a bag intended for me to use it to
fill with souvenirs. My progressive minimalist mindset hadn't even
considered that fact. I wouldn't have bought anything even if I'd
realized it, but it was amazing that a year later it suddenly made
sense.</p>
<p>On the plane I read the first digital version of Wired on my iPad.
Magazines just seem so disorganized, but I like the way they're going
with this. If they make it easier to navigate and somehow make order of
the smaller articles it'll be very appealing, but otherwise I'm still
happy with RSS. I also played a lot of Plants vs Zombies. I finally made
it back to about the point I was at before Tien's nieces unwittingly
deleted my user, not understanding the word &quot;delete&quot; in the menu.</p>
<p>We arrived in Saigon at about 10pm, but our bus didn't leave until
midnight, so we again took the slow approach to travel. We went outside
the airport and sat down to have a drink and some snacks. The air down
here was also nice and cool with a slight breeze, and I wished the
weather in VN could more often be like that. Tien and I talked about
America and what we'd do when we got there.</p>
<p>Our taxi to the bus station had a car stereo with built in karaoke
features, though we didn't use them.</p>
<p>Our bus to Binh Hoa left at midnight and we arrived home at about
4:30am, just before sunrise.</p>
