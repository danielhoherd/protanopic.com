This can become a problem when you have multiple identities loaded, and not all of them are authorized to access private repositories. This can cause commands like &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yarn install&lt;/code&gt; to fail when the unauthorized ssh key is accepted when logging in. This is complicated by the fact that you cannot remove keys from ssh-agent one at a time, you can only reset it entirely, or skip it by setting &lt;code&gt;SSH_AUTH_SOCK=''&lt;/code&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to work around this is to run &lt;code&gt;export GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i path/to/authorized/id_ed25519'&lt;/code&gt;. This will skip all keys that are loaded in the ssh-agent and go straight to the given identity file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of having too many loaded identities also shows up in other scenarios, like when using vagrant, which loads keys, and you are connecting to a device that has a low &lt;code&gt;MaxAuthTries&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://danielhoherd.com/tech-notes/cradlepoint/"&gt;Cradlepoint&lt;/a&gt; modems or &lt;a href="https://libreelec.tv"&gt;LibreElec&lt;/a&gt; devices, especially when you know you will need to enter a password. In these scenarios, you should specify &lt;code&gt;ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="technology"></category><category term="CircleCI"></category><category term="ssh"></category></entry><entry><title>Building Docker Images Without Exposing Private SSH Keys</title><link href="https://protanopic.com/building-docker-images-without-exposing-private-ssh-keys.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-03T18:26:40-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-03T18:26:40-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Hoherd</name></author><id>tag:protanopic.com,2020-12-03:/building-docker-images-without-exposing-private-ssh-keys.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been fighting with getting a docker image built that has to pull from a private github repo, and after talking to CircleCI support I only had one more step to figure out, so I thought I'd share the important bits here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main piece they provided was to enable a newer version of Docker, and set up experimental on the docker daemon. This includes some interesting info: the ability to &lt;code&gt;ssh remote-docker&lt;/code&gt; where you have root access via sudo. Also interesting is that they have newer versions of docker available, but stick to older versions as default to preserve compatibility with existing builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;steps:
  - setup_remote_docker:
      version: 19.03.13
  - run: |
      ssh remote-docker \&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
        sudo bash -c &amp;#39;echo &amp;quot;{\&amp;quot;experimental\&amp;quot;: true}&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/docker/daemon.json&amp;#39;
        sudo systemctl restart docker
      EOF
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include this content in your Dockerfile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.0-experimental&lt;/span&gt;
RUN --mount&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ssh,id&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;github git clone ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DOCKER_BUILDKIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; docker build --ssh&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ssh_private_key_location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; …
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a docker image that does not include the private ssh key. I verified this by running &lt;code&gt;docker save&lt;/code&gt; and grepping the tar file.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="technology"></category><category term="CircleCI"></category></entry><entry><title>Memories in a hole</title><link href="https://protanopic.com/memories-in-a-hole.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-29T17:20:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-10-29T17:20:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Daniel</name></author><id>tag:protanopic.com,2020-10-29:/memories-in-a-hole.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I had a social meeting with a co-worker who lost his brother to cancer a few years ago.

We talked about how you never really get over it, and getting over it is not something you want to do. You learn to live your life with this new hole that you try to fill with good memories. Every once in a while though, you'll be driving down the road or doing whatever, and out of nowhere it's like those good memories fall out of the hole and you suddenly feel that loss all over again. For me, the loss was like a ton of bricks on the word &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot;. I was in my kitchen washing dishes. My mom called me and said &amp;quot;I have some bad news. Kit is dead.&amp;quot; That word &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; hit hard. And sometimes it comes back and hits me again, knocking all the good memories out of the hole. Sometimes I have to push that feeling aside because it's not an appropriate time, but other times I can sit with it for a while, letting my heart ring in the aftershocks, letting my eyes get watery. Then I pick up those good memories and put them back in the hole where my brother was.&lt;/p&gt;

actually written on my blog.  Right now I'm sitting on my front steps in
Chinatown, SF, sipping on cognac and waiting for my wife to come home
with the key to our front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working back at GWOS where I was contracting before my last
trip to Asia.  Tien is going to cosmetology school here in SF and we're
waiting and waiting on immigration to give Tien a green card.  Contrary
to what I believed, getting married does not solve any immigration
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot about life and about traveling lately,
comparing my-our current situation to what it was like last year.  This
time last year Tien and I had just arrived back in Binh Hoa from a trip
to Da Lat.  It was still my second trip.  Near the equator the daylight
does not go away in the winter time, and in Vietnam there is no daylight
savings time darkening your evenings. I can't imagine why on earth they
call it daylight &lt;em&gt;savings&lt;/em&gt; time when it takes your daylight away...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for photography, it's been a little tough to remember to photograph
things every day. The life of a technologist is not the life of a
photographer, only one can be primary. Logical thought and art use two
separate parts of the brain, and creativity in the visual, optical sense
has almost nothing to do with the abstract, logical sense. I must admit,
I've cheated on my 365 project twice this year... thanks to my
technologist side, nobody will ever know which days I cheated on, as
I've fixed my exif data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to traveling again, anywhere, but for now it's time
to sit tight, save money and let things that need to be accomplished be
accomplished.  Tien needs to finish school, immigration needs to do its
thing, and the holidays.. oh the holidays. I want to say that winter
needs to get the hell out of the way, but I know that if I just sit back
and enjoy it then I may actually have a good time.  Luckily for me, San
Francisco winters are warmer than the summers, if not a bit more wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of travel, since Tien is technically in the country
illegally since her visa has expired and the US has no (to my knowledge)
intermediary status between on a fiancé visa and legal resident, we
can't really travel outside the country. This is one of the many
problems with immigration... they say it's legal if you're here as long
as you've filed your paperwork, but there's nothing to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; that
you've filed your paperwork, so as far as anybody knows she's illegal.
Anyhow, we can't travel outside the country, and it's risky even
traveling inside the country. When we do travel inside the country I
have a few places lined up...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to visit Hawaii.  I've never been there even though everybody I
know has told me to go there.  It's beautiful, the ocean is warm, it's a
photographers dream.  To top it off, I have a friend or two there who
wants to show me the local spots.  Sounds great!  Line that up for 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to visit NYC.  I've always wanted to.  Last time I had a plan to
do so was just before 9/11.  In fact, my travel arrangements to the east
coast were on 9/18, the first day you were allowed to fly after 9/11.
Needless to say, I canceled my plans to visit NYC and stuck to the easy
stuff, although a 6,000 mile drive home wasn't exactly easy, even
without the thieves and luggage rack coming undone on the freeway.  So,
I've never been there but I'd love to go.  I have a few friends who live
there, and a few friends in the not so nearby cities like DC and Boston,
which means NYC deserves a good chunk of time above the good chunk of
time that NYC already deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to visit Alaska again.  It'll be my third time, Tien's first.
Alaska is breathtakingly beautiful.  Just gorgeous.  My aunt lives up
there and I fully plan on visiting her next summer during the solstice,
which is a photographers dream come true.  The sun goes across the sky
at a severe angle, never straight above, which leads to hours upon hours
of evening and morning light conditions.  The landscape is wonderful,
the weather is wonderful, the people are wonderful, the outdoors are
wonderful.  Can't wait to get back to Alaska...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to a slight digression from domestic travel... I met My
while I was in Alaska, an her family graciously hosted me while I was in
Thailand.  I regret not having spent more time there... My schedule
wasn't planned, I never knew where I'd be from day to day, and I skipped
out early on Thailand to spend a few days in Laos before returning to
Vietnam, staying for a few weeks and flying off to Malaysia for a week.
I *seriously* need to revisit Malaysia, Thailand and Laos, in that
order, proceeding on to Sapa and the rest of northern Vietnam.  Maybe
even stop off in Burma for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back to domestic travel, there are a few other places I'd like to go
that I've never been.  Mt. Rushmore, The Grand Canyon, Florida, even
Yosimite for heaven's sake.  Hmm.... Maybe I should drive there this
weekend or so... before selling the car, of course.  Tien and I bought a
scooter and it's wicked cool for getting around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, back to Colorado for the holidays.  That's the next plan,
with a possible jaunt down to San Diego for Thanksgiving.  We'll see...
But just writing about my travels has perked me up.  And of course the
cognac had something to do with it, I'm sure... But I do miss traveling,
and I do miss SE Asia and the warm weather.  On the cold days, I dream
of floating in the Bai Sao waters where it was hard to find a spot cool
enough to swim.  I look at those photos and wonder what on earth I'm
doing in dark, cold San Francisco...&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the time is spent playing Wii, PvZ and Marble Mixer, going out
for coffee and tea, and laying around in the heat drinking fresh fruit
juice. This is how most of the time was spent between arriving in Binh
Hoa and the morning of June 9th. That morning we woke up at 3:45 to
catch a bus to Saigon to spend a few days working on immigration stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a morning person, and sleeping on buses is not fun, but somehow
I manage to do it when I'm really tired. I managed to sleep for a few
hours in the bus before we stopped for breakfast. Just after breakfast I
realized that I had lost my iPhone 3G. As I had been miserably trying to
sleep I wasn't really paying attention to what was in my pocket, and had
no good idea of when I could've lost it. We searched the floor and seats
in the bus, and in my pockets, and it was clear that I'd lost it. Tien
switched to Vietnamese mode and began chatting away with the guys in the
front seat, then she made some phone calls and when she turned back to
English mode she'd located my phone and it was safely at the bus station
in Long Xuyen. I'd lost it in a car that belonged to the bus
service that had taken us from a meeting point to the bus station. The
driver found it and turned it in. That was mighty nice of him, though he
couldn't do anything with it since it was locked and armed to wipe the
data after 10 failed attempts. I had actually given it up for loss,
accepting that I'd simply have to buy an iPhone 4 when I got back to
America, but it would be useful to have. Honestly, my iPhone is more
useful than the iPad is because it fits in my pocket. I'd take my iPhone
over my iPad any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we were in Saigon we headed straight to the visa service that Tien
was working with to handle the final details of the process. We spent
the morning there doing paperwork. Actually I mostly played Freecell on
my iPhone while Tien did paperwork, but I ended up having to dig up some
financial records off my laptop and the internet. I did get a little
worried when I plugged my USB containing PDF files with all of my
financial data and it was immediately attacked by a virus. I don't know
all that happened, but I spent a few minutes back on my Mac doing some
CLI-fu to delete all the .exe files that were now scattered around my
USB drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over lunch I explained to Tien exactly why a service that handles the
personal details of immigrants, including all personal details, should
take extra care to keep their computers free of viruses. I explained
that how an infected computer is &amp;quot;owned&amp;quot;, meaning the people controlling
the virus have more control of your computer than you do, and thus have
access to all of your data. I explained that it was possible that the
virus had taken my personal financial information that was all neatly
contained in two PDF files, one from Ameriprise Financial and one from
the IRS, and sent them off to another computer where somebody could use
them to do anything I could do with my finances, like open new lines of
credit or transfer funds to other bank accounts. Her expression was
something of a horrified wonder, and she said she had no idea it could
be so complex. I told her that a lot of people don't understand that,
like the people at the visa service, which is why online crime is so
easy. I didn't tell her about the millions of dollars I'd made... er...
nevermind... *ahem*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we'd be spending more time near the consulate we found a hotel
nearby there and relaxed for the rest of the evening. Our room had two
twin beds, a comical feature to us both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 10th was spent mostly at hospitals. Tien had to get some blood
work, shots, x-ray's and some other medical tests for her immigration.
We both spent most of the day waiting in the lobby. I watched all the
people going here and there, doing their exams, and found it funny when
one girl took off her high heels shoes when she got weighed, but put
them back on before they measured her height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night we went to a nice restaurant on the 12th floor of a hotel
with a view out over district 1 and had a nice dinner. The food was
good, as was the wine, and we were the only people there so it was nice
and quiet, a rare experience in Saigon. The waiter spoke in an
interesting accent, and it almost sounded more Chinese than Vietnamese.
I wished more Vietnamese people spoke that way because it was easier for
me to hear the structure of the language. Tien said that it was the
polite way to talk to people you don't know as opposed to the friendly
banter where linguistic rules and elocution are tossed aside.&lt;/p&gt;

had another day to kill, so we took no care to wake up early on June
2nd. Tien was craving bao cake so we went and got that for breakfast,
and of course coffee. While we were lounging around wasting the morning
that we had hoped to be traveling, I got another disappointing e-mail,
this time from the Consulate in Saigon. It said they were raising the
prices of the visa application from $131 to $350 taking effect 8
business days before Tien's interview. At least it wasn't worse, saying
they were no longer taking interviews or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked out, walked around and hired a bus to take us to the airport
later, then went back to the ol' Quintessence of Hanoian. It was a nice,
cool day, perfect weather. Overcast enough to keep the temperature cool,
but still bright enough that it wasn't gloomy, with a cool breeze to
keep the air fresh. Perfect weather to while away a spare day drinking
coffee by the historic lake that Tien used to dream about as a girl.
Unfortunately we had too much time, and that cafe had no wireless, so we
went to find another place to stay. We found ourselves at the best ice
cream shop I've ever been to. Fanny Ice Cream. If you're ever in Hanoi,
go there. It's amazing. They don't have food though, but somehow Tien
and I managed to stay there for hours surfing the net, eating ice cream
and drinking fruit juice. The food part as a poor decision because we
ended up not being able to get food before it was time to leave for the
airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic on the way to the airport was typical Hanoi traffic, too many
cars on narrow roads. There was an accident with a car and a moto, and
one with a bus and a cow. I actually enjoy sitting in Hanoi traffic
though because looking at the scenery is fun. The architecture is great,
and for some reason the whole city is just eye catching to me. If Tien
and I ever have to move there for work or something, I will not be
disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally got a chance to eat after checking into our flight, then we
went inside the secure area to wait for our plane. I decided to stand
since I'd been sitting most of the day, and it was interesting to see
what everybody was up to. I saw a man with a bright duffel bag full of
souvenirs, and it suddenly dawned on me that the tourist people on my
first trip to Hanoi who had given me a bag intended for me to use it to
fill with souvenirs. My progressive minimalist mindset hadn't even
considered that fact. I wouldn't have bought anything even if I'd
realized it, but it was amazing that a year later it suddenly made
sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plane I read the first digital version of Wired on my iPad.
Magazines just seem so disorganized, but I like the way they're going
with this. If they make it easier to navigate and somehow make order of
the smaller articles it'll be very appealing, but otherwise I'm still
happy with RSS. I also played a lot of Plants vs Zombies. I finally made
it back to about the point I was at before Tien's nieces unwittingly
deleted my user, not understanding the word &amp;quot;delete&amp;quot; in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Saigon at about 10pm, but our bus didn't leave until
midnight, so we again took the slow approach to travel. We went outside
the airport and sat down to have a drink and some snacks. The air down
here was also nice and cool with a slight breeze, and I wished the
weather in VN could more often be like that. Tien and I talked about
America and what we'd do when we got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our taxi to the bus station had a car stereo with built in karaoke
features, though we didn't use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bus to Binh Hoa left at midnight and we arrived home at about
4:30am, just before sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

to do anything. We spent the morning being lazy but eventually made it
out to enjoy the city. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4671091824/"&gt;&lt;img alt="32::AM::143" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4671091824_aacc885614_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We found no shortage of camera
shops, which was great because a lot of them had vintage gear that was
neat to see. I stopped into one and priced an SD card to help me hack
the Wii, and ended up going back for it later when I found out it was
the best deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strolled down to the cafe by the lake that we'd eaten at last time we
were in Hanoi. Its &amp;quot;The Quintessence of Hanoian&amp;quot;, though I can't
remember the name. The cafe is nice but there's no internet, which kinda
sucks, especially when there's an e-mail waiting in your inbox that
tells you that your flight on the next morning has been canceled and
you've been put on a flight later that evening. I got that e-mail when
we eventually found internet elsewhere, but it was too late to check out
of our hotel that day even if we could get on a flight that evening, so
we stayed. We did call them on the phone to plea with them to
reconsider, but the best they could do was put us on a flight at 8pm,
not 9pm. So much for arriving home at a decent hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we decided to check out a western restaurant. I had seen it
while we were walking around and decided to check it out to get away
from the continual asian selections we were surviving on. This night I
got pizza, nachos, and sangria, and Tien got honey chicken. None of it
was the best I'd had, but it was delicious and welcome to my taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we went down to the lake to watch the sun set. We missed
the most beautiful parts of it, but it was still nice and we sat down
there for a while taking photos and just watching the world. Just before
we left, power flickered on and off in a large part of the city, and
when we got back to our neighborhood the power was out on the entire
block. Tien didn't want to go into the hotel because it was dark and
scary and probably too hot, but I wanted to make it to our air
conditioned room. Sure the power was out, but it hadn't been all night,
and the room was probably nice and cool. In fact, the room was nice and
cool, and the power came on just after we found our way up the candle
lit stairwell and into the room.&lt;/p&gt;

longer than I liked so I decided to shave my head, but when I went to
use my electric razor the battery was practically dead. To top it off, I
soon found out I had killed the charger by plugging it into a 220v
outlet that it was not made for. So long, electric device, another
casualty of world travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I decided to go after the only geocache on the Island which was
located somewhere in the center of the island. I tried to find a good
map of the island but couldn't, and the topo maps available via the
Geocaching iPhone app were pretty poor. This sucked because the iPhone's
assisted (aka, retarded) GPS doesn't work unless you have cell
reception, which I do not since my phone is locked to AT&amp;amp;T's network.
With that in mind I read all of the hints and logs, and found out that
the geocache was located at the bottom of the very tower I had joked
about climbing to the top of, on top of Ngu Lam Peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4717569796/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hiking the wrong trail" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4717569796_c1ae01a8d2_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 66px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We mounted our moto and headed out for the
park where the trailhead was. Unfortunately I was thinking like a n00b
and totally forgot to bring food and water. On top of that, we ended up
on the wrong trail, one that went up and down steep rocks through deep
jungle. There were a lot of butterflies and some animals in the forest
making some crazy sounds like a digeridoo. Eventually we ran into some
folks who were coming the other way down the trail and when Tien asked
them if we were headed towards the tower they said no. They told us
where the right trail was, we hadn't taken the right exit off the main
road. We turned around and headed back to the bike, hiking about half
the way with the other party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4717426514/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking up to Ngu Lam Peak" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4717426514_5fec5ac645_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 70px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once we got back to the main road, where
we were in clear view of our destination, we turned towards home and
immediately passed a huge gate with people selling food and
refreshments. It was the gateway to the right trail. I made a joke about
going to climb it, not really being serious because our energy had been
pretty spent on the wrong trail and we still hadn't eaten anything. Tien
said she was up for the hike though, and with several verifications that
she was serious we parked our bike and got some refreshments. The sun
had just come out, having been hidden behind a nice layer of low clouds
all morning, so we walked for a short while in the sun before
disappearing back into the jungle and up a steep incline of steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little ways up the trail was a sign that was pretty confusing, but we
figured out that it basically said &amp;quot;left is the shorter hard way, right
is the longer easy way.&amp;quot; We went left into what was hardly recognizable
as a trail. Muddy rocks, frogs, butterflies, crazy vines and deep jungle
going up steep, jagged rocks. We encountered two girls who were coming
down and talked to them a little bit about what was up ahead. They said
it was a lot of the same, and since it was manageable we continued. It
soon became much less steep and merged back with the easy trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a blue gorilla pod that was placed on a rock on display,
probably put there by the girls to be easy to spot by whoever lost it. I
figured this was a bad idea so I took it and hung it from my backpack,
expecting better chances of running into the owner along the trail, but
never found them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that was odd was that there were crabs running around on the
rocks. I had seen a few on the previous trail too and thought it was
odd, I'd never seen crabs anywhere away from the ocean, and this was
far, far from the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ascended a few metal ladders that were bolted onto some steep rocks
and peeked out of the forest to see a grand view of the island and its
many steep hill tops. I recalled that the cache hints had said it was
near that spot, so I consulted them and we doubled back to look for it.
It was easy to find once we were in the right spot. There was a travel
bug inside of it that had been there for two months, so even though I
had nothing to leave, I took the TB to remove it from its exile. It
wanted to visit zoos, so I made the plan to take it to Cheyenne Mountain
Zoo, almost on the exact opposite side of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our objective complete, Tien and I continued the short distance to
the top of the hill where the tower was. It was a rusty metal tower from
the war in the 60's. It hadn't been noticeably repaired, and there was a
sign indicating that it wasn't safe for more than 4 people. While Tien
and I were at the cache a european couple passed us, and now they were
up on the tower, so that made four of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4656061067/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down from Ngu Lam Tower" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4656061067_645f4d847f_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 64px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tien and I started up the stairs that
circled around the core of the tower, but her acrophobia kicked in and
she got pretty scared and by the second landing she said she was too
scared to continue. I was certainly not going to force her to climb this
scary spectacle, but I myself was not about to back down, so I left her
there knowing she could make it back down on her own as I continued to
the top. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4716872437/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tien and I at the top of Ngu Lam Tower" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4716872437_faaf738e01_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 63px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When I got to the top
the european couple was up there admiring the scenery, which was
incredible. It looked like an unrealistic landscape that some novice
would make in Bryce 3d. I exchanged photo taking duties with the couple,
and right as they were finishing taking my photo Tien appeared on the
stairs, she had overcome her fears and made it to the top. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4654745716/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking out over Cat Ba Island" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/4654745716_8e44267fa2_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 41px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They took some photos of the two of us, and I took
some panorama and HDR sets, admired the view with my own eyes, and then
we started down. Just as we were starting down, the european man
remarked about how he was a structural engineer and seeing the state of
the rusty metal made him want to get off the tower as quickly as
possible because it was not safe. It was at that brittle stage of rusty,
where you can break off parts of the metal. They went quicker down the
stairs than Tien and I did, &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4658077441/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Down the tower" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4658077441_a8925f6c7f_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 66px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and I let Tien go ahead of
me so we weren't all on the same stairwell, spacing out our weight so as
to not overbear this artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4654247455/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Below a rusty tower" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4654247455_c7b4f82a03_t.jpg" style="width: 66px; height: 100px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When Tien and I got to the bottom we were all
alone again. We had some snacks from the gateway at the bottom, so we
took a break to eat bananas, drink a coke, and clean out the potato
chips that had spilled in our bag. Everything that was in the bag now
smelled like imitation crab. Who ever heard of crab flavored pringles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were eating, Tien and I talked about adventuring. She said this
was the first time she had ever done this sort of thing, and I was proud
of her. Not only did she do it, she did it after having taken the wrong
trail where we had no food, farther from her home than she'd ever been
before on and island with steep rocky terrain through a dense jungle
crawling with crabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we started down we ran into a group of young adventurers who had
come up the easy way. We checked with them how to get there, and once we
found it it ended up not being too much easier than the hard way. Sure
it wasn't as steep, but it had rusty metal handrails that had broken
apart and become javelins waiting to impale you if you slipped on the
muddy rocks. Tien did slip, and thankfully she did not impale herself,
but she broke the band of her engagement ring in half when she caught it
on a sharp rock. I was glad she hadn't cut herself open in the process,
but we were definitely going to have to get it fixed. The rest of the
way down was easier than I expected, given the terrain, and at the
bottom was a man with a shop and a deep well where he drew buckets of
cold fresh water for us. We bought ice cream, water and beer and relaxed
before plodding back to our motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back was Hospital Cave, a cave that had been converted into a
secret hospital for troops during the war. I really wanted to see what
it was like, but after two trails we were dead tired so we skipped it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4659229174/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Autoswimmers" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4659229174_c461887647_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 75px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Back at the hotel I took a shower to wash off the
buckets of sweat and caked mud on my legs, then we headed back to Cat Co
2 for a swim to cool down our muscles. The water was a bit chilly, but
worse than that, it was really dirty. There was trash of plastic and
organic kinds floating in the water all along the beach. I thought about
the clear, warm water of Phu Quoc and wished we were back at Bai Sao. We
took some photos and left, this Cat Co thing was not our idea of fun.
Instead we went back to Bamboo and had dinner while most of the island
was without power. It was funny to see the mainland all dark while the
floating restaurants and hotels in the bay were all lit up, powered by
their boat motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4716770843/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Child Cyclo" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4716770843_34edbfd456_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 75px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There was a boy riding a child-size cyclo up and down the
street giving other kids rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few kids came riding by on bikes emblazoned with the word &amp;quot;exercise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel we went upstairs, realized we'd forgotten the key at
the front desk, and on my way down to get it I slipped and fell on the
stone stairwell, bruising both of my forearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silence and whir of the fan told us how the power flickered on and
off all night long&lt;/p&gt;

where Tien's cousin has just built a house. Many members of Tien's
family were gathering to remember the anniversary of the death of Tien's
grandmother. We grabbed breakfast in LX on the way and everybody was
chatting away while I ate. It was strange to be surrounded by such
lively and continual conversation of which I didn't understand a word,
and it made me remember that I was foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before we got to her cousin's house we got pulled over by the cops
and had to stay there for 20 minutes or so while the police checked
papers and things I don't know. I was a tad worried that I'd need my
passport, which I didn't have on me, but they didn't ask for it and we
were allowed to go on with no trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new house was nearly complete, but still in a state of final
construction. Many new trees of various kinds had supports to hold them
up, and there were miscellaneous construction materials laying in the
yard. There were a bunch of folks already there, some that I recognized
and many that I did not. There were a bunch of older men sitting at a
table drinking tea and talking on and on, laughing and looking into the
distance. They invited me to sit and drink tea with them, and Tien said
they wished that they could speak with me natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, incense was lit and put into vases at little shrines, and
everybody stood and sang a chanting song in honor of Tien's grandmother
who had died several years ago. Some people approached a photo and bowed
to pray and give offerings in memory. Afterwards we all had a meal and
there was a lot more conversation that I didn't understand, but smiles
and gestures go a long way on good spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch the family hung around and talked for a long time. I played
with the kids a lot, since games don't really need language. They were
playing with a chicken that was tethered by its leg to a tree in the
yard. It somehow managed to climb up the tree and over a branch and
ended up hanging by its one leg from the tree itself. I shooed the kids
away and untangled the string from the tree, but the chicken just lay
nearly lifeless on the ground. I wasn't sure if its leg was broken, but
it certainly had no more will to flee the threat of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home I slept, since I had a whole bench seat in the van to me
and Tien. We went shopping at the mall in LX and I managed to find a
helmet that just barely fit me. I also found WiFi on my iPhone, and got
online for the first time in a while to respond to some friends and see
what people elsewhere are up to. More and more I find that Facebook
isn't really good for keeping up on what people are up to so much as it
is a place to waste time with other people who want to waste time.
Twitter is even worse. Direct messages are almost the only ways I can
really communicate and keep up with people, unless I happen to catch a
piece of useful info in the noisy stream of jokes, links and statements
of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home from LX we turned up some dance music and had a fun,
rowdy time in the car. I saw a banner for KFC and wondered if there
would actually be one in LX soon... this place doesn't seem like a good
target market for that corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at home we got back to feeding our addiction to Super Mario Wii.
This can be really fun, but there is an extra level of frustration to
that game when you can't talk to your team mates. &amp;quot;Get on the &amp;#64;#(&amp;amp;*$#&amp;#64;
square or it won't start moving!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We have to fly up into that pipe up
there!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Everybody ground pound on three!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Please don't live inside the
bubble, I might actually need to use it.&amp;quot; Then there are the things like
gathering as many power-ups as they can, even when they don't need them
and you do, or pressing the power button on the Wiimote when somebody
walks away, ending your game just before you get that third big coin by
the end of the castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, communication is a key component of that game. We love it though,
and we played it all the next day, along with iPad games. I bought Plans
vs Zombies for the iPad, which was a hit. We'd also been playing a lot
of Marble Mixer, Flight Control, Air Harp, Diner Dash and Magic Piano.
The iPad isn't good at a lot of things, but it's sure great for gaming
and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

again to go to Ha Tien beach. We went to LX to have lunch and surf the
net and check out the bus station schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed a white man with a white trimmed beard and thick nerdy glasses
riding a bicycle through the back streets of LX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go to Phu Quoc instead of Ha Tien, and decided to go the
next morning. We'd hoped that somebody from Tien's family would come but
everybody had reasons to stay so it was just us two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on May 19 we woke up to catch our bus. There were men outside of
thus house digging a ditch for a pipe of some sort. They were chiseling
right through the tile on thus front patio, and not one of them was
wearing protective eye gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it was early I didn't feel tired like I had for the previous
few days and I remembered that my body adjusts it's energy level for the
pending activities. Now that we had plans I was wide awake and ready to
rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we headed out I got a feeling that I setimes get on motorbikes... The
naked feeling that I should buckle in somehow, as if I'm in a car. Of
course there are no seatbelts on motorbikes, and in VN there aren't
often seatbelts in cars or buses either. If they're there they don't get
used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ride to the bus station I saw a woman go to adjust the mirror on
her motorbike and have it break clean off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the station at 8:10 and before long we found ourselves driving
on the wrong side of the road with a man hanging out of the open bus
door yelling. We sped past two trucks on our right as a tinny voice
blared out of a loudspeaker to our left and the sound of an alarm could
be heard from somewhere ahead. Just another typical day of travel in
Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a cafe where there was a sign with some Japanese fantasy
character on it. The word &amp;quot;internet&amp;quot; was followed by some Chinese
characters and then the words &amp;quot;Final Step 3.0&amp;quot;... oh squaresoft, look
what you've done. Same to you, internet buzzword machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus continued it loud caper down the highway which parralleled a
river all the way to the coast. There was a shrine on the dashboard and
a spare incense holder affixed to the frame of the passenger side
window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off at Rach Soi and took motorbike taxis about 12 km to the
superdong ferry in Rach Gia. The ferry only left twice daily and we were
early, so we ate some food and waited. I noticed them loading motorbikes
on and off of other boats and had tien get th price of what it would
cost to take a motorbike. At 170k it wouldve been a much cheaper
alternative. Next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boat ride was pretty smooth and we passed many small islands. The
seats were pretty small though and I was glad when we finally arrived.
The boat hadn't let us off where I thought it would. I thought it was
dropping us off in the city and so we hadn't bought a bus ticket to te
town. We ended up getting a taxi for not too much more who took us to a
decent hotel where we got a room and rented a motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were hoping to go swimming and so we headed off in the bike to cruise
the coast in search of a nice beach, but it was too dark and the road
was under heavy construction which made it hard for us to navigate. We
ended up going back to the hotel and taking a quick dip in warm, dark
water with rapidly breaking waves. The swimming conditions weren't good
so we headed back to the hotel, grabbed the bike and heade to the night
market for dinner. The night market was small and didn't have anything
interesting, so we had our food and retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over dinner I thought back to one year ago when I was preparing for my
first trip to VN. it was strang e to think that in one year, trawling
internationally, staying at random hotels in random places and
discovering new areas has become normal. It wa strange to think back to
a time when my comfort zone was so small that each night I wanted to be
in my own bed. Now I don't even own a bed, much less care where I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

moved their shop one door down to the entryway where the food stalls
are. Hanging in their shop was a shirt that said &amp;quot;Chicago holiday in
member recruitment we require oral interview.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a familiar breakfast there before returning to the house to play
some Wii. After lunch the power went out, and we spent the rest of the
evening playing games on the iPad, eating fruit and playing badminton in
the street behind Thu's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of folks passed us on the street and gave different expressions,
from happy smiles to uninterested expression. One girl was wearing a
shirt that said &amp;quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On may 15th, like many days to come, we woke up with no power. Nhi and
Ngoc spent the morning singing You are my Sunshine and playing it on the
iPad Air Harp. It was a pretty lazy day, with a few more to come. I
thought about a video I saw on the plane that used the same phrase as
the Lonely Planet book when describing Vietnam: Life in the fast lane.
As I lay in a hammock eating cake and drinking fresh squeezed orange
juice in a house with no power I failed to find any fast lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I decided to go to LX to cool off in a cafe and surf the net
for a while. On our way we passed a man missing both legs from above his
knees. He was shuffling slowly down the side of the highway using two
blocks of wood under his thighs as a sort of shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a new cafe just off the main street. There was a No Kissing
sign by the door and a photo of GW Bush in the bathroom with his
fingertips touching his head and the text &amp;quot;in Texas we call this a brain
sucker starving.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home we went by an electronics shop to pick up a headphone
splitter and price a 110/220v converter to hook up the Wii and the WiFi
at the same time, but ended up not getting it because of the price.
Limited technology isn't a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home I saw a whole family on a motorbike. Dad was driving,
mom was cradling a sleeping child on the back and the family dog was
resting its from paws on the handlebars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was still no power when we got home. Luckily rain came and cooled
everything off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I made some plans to go to a nearby beach, Ha Tien. We talked
about leaving the next morning, but instead spent the next few days
lazing around Binh Hoa playing Wii and iPad and badminton. Still can't
find that fast lane.&lt;/p&gt;

the river. It looked nicer on the map than it actually was, due to
construction and heavy traffic, but it was nice all the same. We ran
into an Australian couple and asked them to take our picture, then
chatted about traveling Vietnam for a while. They said they were staying
at the foot of a very large, impressive skyscraper that was being built
nearby that I'd been talking about with Tien earlier. It's a financial
tower, and I was talking about how its presence will definitely change
the surrounding areas, which were already showing a heavy western
influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a cafe and sat for a while, watching Hero, drinking smoothies
and playing with the iPad. The walk back to the hotel was longer than
I'd remembered, and by the time we got there it was time for lunch. We
went back to the restaurant we'd eaten lunch at the day before and this
time I took time to scrutinize the menu a bit more. It had some very
interesting things, to say the least... Sauted [sic] noodle w. 3 special
objects, Cow marrow ommelette [sic], Sauted [sic] ox pennis [sic] w.
Satay, Grilled bloody clam w. fat &amp;amp; green onion, and Grilled crocodile
file [sic] w. fish sauce were some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched a movie, then went out for doughnuts. They gave us a receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back I saw a lingerie store with two half naked mannequins in
the front window. A sign read &amp;quot;50% off.&amp;quot; Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we entered the hotel the man at the front desk lowered his cell
phone, which he was holding facing the door, and greeted us. It was
interesting because I'd seen him do that before and thought he might be
taking our picture. Also of note was that nobody at the hotel was
familiar. Tien had gotten to know the staff before and they recognized
us every time, but this time nobody knew us, and here was some guy doing
something potentially creepy. It weirded me out and I mentioned it to
Tien in the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 13 we headed to our usual breakfast spot and sat upstairs looking
down on the intersection. I watched all the different people passing by
and thought about all the different ways of life in Saigon, and the
world in general. I wondered which of my friends would enjoy coming to
Saigon and which would have a hard time adjusting. Tien and I talked a
lot about cultural differences and how hard it is to give people insight
into what a foreign place is actually like, and I said I couldn't really
think of much to show her what American culture would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan was for us to take off to Vung Tau, Mui Ne or Nha
Trang for a while, but we decided to go back to her hometown and then go
off to Ha Tien beach instead, so we booked a bus home and headed out.
The bus driver was really fast and we expected the trip to only last 4.5
hours. The music was loud and there was an intermittent sound of one of
those really irritating alarm clocks. We also passed the scene of a
motorbike wreck that had just happened. Fluids were still flowing across
the highway from the mangled wreckage and a bleeding man was in the arms
of another man on the back of a motorbike that was just taking off down
the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we came upon the wreck, Tien had been in the middle of telling me a
joke, which she told like this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;There was a blue and a red monkey sitting in a tree. The blue monkey
jumped into the river, which one was left?&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;The blue one.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;No, that would be too easy.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;WTF, is that the joke?&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;People here think it's funny!&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;I think it's retarded, that's not remotely funny. So that's the
punchline? 'No, that would be too easy'?&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;Then how does it go??&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;There's a blue monkey and a red monkey sitting in a tree. The red one
jumped into the river, which one is left?&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;The blue one...&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;Nope, the right one.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;WTF, that doesn't make any sense.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;No, it's the opposite!&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;The opposite of what...? Left? Wrong?&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;No, of wet.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;Right is not the opposite of wet. Dry is.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, yeah, the dry one.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us 2 hours to get to the other side of the big bridge in Tan
Hoa, something I'd never timed before but wanted to do because it always
seems to take forever to get from there to Saigon. There was a cute
little kid sitting ahead of us that I'd been playing with from time to
time. He was really shy, but he warmed up to me and began playing little
games with me. Then he began spitting, and all the sudden he wasn't cute
at all anymore. He was just a rude little bastard that I wanted to
smack. I didn't though, and eventually his mom did so for me and made
him behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right as we left Long Xuyen heading for Binh Hoa it began to rain
heavily. We passed two people on a motorbike and sprayed them with
water, and to top it off, one of the employees on the bus opened his
window, pointed at them and laughed at their misfortune. I found this
doubly hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started adjusting my things to get ready to get off the bus, when I
noticed that my wallet was missing all of the US dollars that had been
in it. When they were in it, I don't remember, but they were missing
then. All that I knew was that my wallet had been in my pocket since we
left the hotel, and that meant that somebody at the Ruby Star had been
the one who took it. Maybe that creep with the cell phone, maybe the
cleaning staff, I'll probably never find out. I'll probably never go
back to the Ruby Star either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was right as soon as I settled on that when we realized the bus had
missed the stop in Binh Hoa and was crossing over the bridge into the
neighborhood on the other side of the river. Tien argued a little with
the bus folks and they ended up dropping us off on the other side of the
bridge where rain water was flooding a business at the side of the road.
We crossed to a cafe on the drier side of the road and got some coffee.
Tien's sister was busy fighting a leak in the roof of her new house and
said she'd come get us when the rain stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I sat and talked a while with the family who owned the shop.
They wanted to talk to me and asked a lot of questions about where I was
from, how we knew each other, and said I was handsome. This tends to be
the standard set of interaction between Tien, me and interested
strangers. She thinks it's remarkable how everybody says I'm handsome,
but I think it's probably just custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a family next door to the coffee shop who knew Tiens
family, so we went over there and visited for a few minutes before
Tien's brother and sister showed up on two motorbikes to take us back to
the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Thu's house, which I had never seen before, and relaxed
with the family, finally home. We ate some doughnuts that we'd bought in
Saigon, and some chocolate I had brought from America, and tried to find
batteries for a remote controlled helicopter that I'd brought as a
joking gift for Tien that stemmed from a conversation we'd had online
about flying over the puddles. The helicopter ended up being a lot of
fun though and I'm glad I brought it. It wasn't nearly as entertaining
as the Wii that I brought though. Tien said she doesn't know anybody in
Vietnam who has a Wii, and had never seen one before I showed it to her
online a few weeks back.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm crashing at his place while he's gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished a crazy, long day at work with network config, server
upgrades, Linux active directory authentication problems relating to a
windows server meltdown that also caused DNS and VPN meltowns. This
infrastructure is not exactly high availability.  It started at 6am and
here at 10pm it's almost over... On top of that I managed to work out
the details of a landing visa for my trip to saigon next week and line
up a small crew for how weird this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's such a foreign world here in SF compared to the remote Mekong farm
village where Tien grew up and is staying these days. I love technology,
and I need to make money, but I have to find a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need immigration to approve Tiens visa.  It's been over five months
since I last saw Tien, which is a long time to go without seeing
anybody, let alone your fiancé. Too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I went to San Jose for Sadeks birthday and caught up with a
ton of folks I hadn't seen in a long time. I've managed to fit in quite
a few good visits in my last few weeks here, though unfortunately a few
have not come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's strange to consider the levels of anticipation between my trips.
The first time I left I was burned out on work, going into the unknown
ready for whatever. The second time I was lovestruck and impatient for
things to move on freely. This time I seem exhausted and underwhelmed.
I've been so focused on projects at work and dealing with the details
that I feel like I've lost touch with the joys that I'm pursuing.  When
I stop to think about the situation I am either emotionally swelled with
missing Tien or incredibly frustrated and nearly broken over this
ridiculous US immigration saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need a vacation, that's for sure. Maybe I'll go back to Nha Trang...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's weird to think back to a time when I cared where I slept at night.&lt;/p&gt;

home by this time. My stomach was a little bit upset, probably from the
meds, but it was better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time we were in town I had seen a building I wanted to check
out that looked like a great vantage point to take photographs from. We
went out after breakfast and wandered around the streets looking for it.
We never ended up finding it though. I had really wanted to take some
tilt/shift photos from the top of it, which looked like it might be a
restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we caught a bus back to Binh Hoa and managed to score the
front seat for once. I enjoyed the ride and the change of perspective
from the typical bus rides we get where we have to sit in the back. I
thought back to my first bus trip to Binh Hoa which was in the middle of
the night. The roads were winding and bumpy with lots of short uphills
and downhills. I had thought this was us driving through mountains, but
this time I could clearly see in the daylight that it was just bridges
over rivers and there were no mountains in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening I felt like I may be having some unreasonable side effects
from the medicine and so I decided to go off of them. This was a great
opportunity for me to finish some wine that Tien's family wouldn't be
able to, and that put me into a deep deep sleep that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day was a lazy day spent in Tien's village. That evening we
went out and cruised around the city with her sisters while they were
shopping for some stuff. Tien and I spent a lot of time waiting for them
to finish what they were doing. We occupied ourselves by looking for
cool things to photograph and ended up down by the river. A little while
later we met up with her sisters and we all went to eat dinner by the
river. I got eaten alive by mosquitoes and the food was only OK. I was
in a funk from that, the general mood of the evening and the fact that
I'd be leaving the next day. I wished that something would be different,
that we wouldn't be spending the last evening waiting and riding around
Long Xuyen on a scooter killing idle time. That's how it was though, and
after dinner we went home to Binh Hoa for my last night in the Mekong on
this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

upset, probably from some meds I was still taking for my lingering strep
throat, which echoed from my last trip home to the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien's sisters had prepared some gifts for my family and it was a puzzle
trying to fit everything into my backpack. We managed to get everything
fit in, though in less of a modular fashion that I would've liked. I try
to leave my laptop and camera easily accessible right at the top of my
bag, but that wasn't possible this time because of some very odd shapes.
We settled with that though and then took a nap, trying to get a head
start on rest since my flight left Saigon at 6am which meant we had to
travel all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's always interesting trying to find ways to kill that last unknown
bit of time before the bus shows up, and this time around I loaded up
Tien's netbook with snes9x and all the ROMs I had. Tien's nieces had
never played SNES before, but they also didn't read english. i tried to
show them how to work the emulator but hand gestures were again
exhausted and I'm sure they didn't get everything I was trying to show
them. I made a note to bring them back some USB controllers so they
could play together without having to share the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to saigon was the same as always except our driver was notable
bad. We arrived in Saigon at 2am, practically asleep. In fact, we did
sleep for a while on a bench in some garage at some transit stop where
the bus had ended up. I wasn't sure what exactly the place was, but it
didn't look like a travel agency. A man offered to give us a ride to the
airport, which was nice, but he dropped us off right outside the airport
instead of taking us inside so we had to catch another taxi the last
1km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 3:15am when we finally got to the airport. I left Tien with my
bag outside and went inside to check into my flight, which took less
than 5 minutes. Tien, Thu and I sat around outside visiting for the last
bit of my trip, taking photos and trying to stay awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time for me to go, Tien and I embraced one last time and
she melted into my arms. I tried to be strong and positive, but nothing
prepares me for that sense of disconnection when I let go of her hand
and walked away, realizing that I was then separated by a growing time
and distance. It only lasted a minute though, because I had to be ready
to navigate immigration and the security checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security was easy this time around, but required a mandatory bag
inspection at the gate. This was so inconvenient after the puzzle of
packing that stuff into my bag, but I managed to the contents back in
with little fuss. My flight left on time, and after sleeping most of the
flight away I had a beautiful and clear view of Japan on our descent
into Narita. Japan is an absolutely beautiful country and I really want
to go explore it some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got online for a while in Narita and chatted with some folks back
home. I would be arriving in San Francisco only a few hours date-wise
after my departure from Saigon because of the time difference, meaning I
flew out at 6am and would be landing at 8am. Kyung asked me to pick him
up some Japanese kit-kat's, and I got some mochi for Lila. I also jumped
on skype and re-activated my AT&amp;amp;T cell phone so I would have mobile
internet as soon as I landed in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plane to America I was seated next to a scholarly looking
Japanese girl. She was studying law of some sort and asked me to keep
the window shut because she was allergic to sunlight. I had ever intent
of sleeping the majority of the flight away and had no qualms keeping
the window closed. Usually, in fact, the flight attendants ask you to do
so. I soon fell asleep listening to Kaskade, and the sleep was welcome
to my confused body that probably was ready to sleep at any time of the
day or night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up I started listening to an Audiobook I had picked up, The
Forever War. It wasn't really gripping me though and I found myself
struggling to follow the story rather than let my own imagination wander
away. I wondered why they didn't have audiobooks as one of the features
of on-plane entertainment, and for that matter why they didn't have
podcasts. This was the terrible entertainment system from my previous
flight overseas though, so it wouldn't surprise me if the whole thing
broke down to colored bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put some music back on and began to wake up more, thinking about what
I'd do in America. I became inspired to get my shit back on track, to do
great things, to return to work and resume making money. I had taken so
much time off in the last few months and was feeling an insatiable
desire to get back to creative construction of art and technology. I
decided to hit life hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake came and picked me up at SFO and took me down to Cupertino where
Lila had my car. We went to Sugar and found my key on Lila's desk, but
she wasn't there, so the two of us headed down to Barefoot Coffee to
pacify my craving for western coffee. Barefoot is the best place to do
this, by the way, because it's probably the best coffee shop I've been
to in the world. After western coffee the next order of business was to
get a proper mexican lunch, which is another thing I can't seem to find
outside of North America. Kyung and Chris met us at Tres Potrillos in
Sunnyvale and we all caught up on travels, technological bs, life and
whatnot. It was great to be back with my friends in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all went our separate ways and I headed up to Lila's house to pick up
some things I'd left there. Every time I get to her house I don't want
to leave because it's so peaceful and beautiful, but somehow it seems
that almost every time I get to her house I'm in a hurry to go somewhere
else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to SF was nice, as always, and obviously very familiar since
I'd done it hundreds of times before. It never gets old though, 280
between Cupertino and San Francisco is one of the most beautiful
highways in America. When I got to SF my storage unit was closed, which
sucked but wasn't really a big deal. I also checked my post office box
and retrieved my month's worth of mail which did not include the receipt
for Tien's visa petition, known in the immigration community as NOA1.
Later I would call them on the phone and find out that they had in fact
sent it and everything was rolling along fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed a few blocks down to Crossroads Cafe where I had met the SF
Flickr Social crew before my trip. It's a quiet spot with cheap drinks
and good parking. There's no internet though, so I was happy that I'd
hacked my iPhone and gotten tethering to work. Lily called me and then
came down to meet me. I packed up and we went a few blocks over to Nova
to get some drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our walk from the car we saw a man whose motorcycle had fallen and
knocked two other motorcycles over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was good to see her and she caught me up to speed on a lot of the
things going on in SF and in her life. She was actually on her way out
of town so after a drink and a conversation I dropped her off at the
BART station and headed over to the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there at the beach for a while, thinking about my position. No
job, no home, nowhere in particular to be. This was freedom, but
sometimes freedom comes with emptiness. Freedom longs for aspiration
because without it stagnation pools. I didn't want to be stagnant, but I
was so exhausted I wasn't exactly inspired either. Honestly I just
wanted to chill out and relax for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called Rob and then rolled over to his house. He had just got a pizza
and was ready to watch Inglorious Basterds in 1080p, and that was
exactly the kind of night I was looking for. American cinema, beer and
pizza with my amigo. The movie was beautiful, though a bit drawn out,
but all in all it was a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed back to the BLT's house and nobody was home. That night I slept
for 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

Having less than a week left I decided to go ahead and figure out my
plan for when I arrived back in America. Some of my friends were online
since it was evening in the USA, and I figured out that I'd spend a few
days in SF and then drive to CO just after Thanksgiving to spend some
time with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien was sleeping while I figured all of this out, and I was touched
with a magic that so many other people in history have been touched
with, that of being simply alive and doing normal activities while their
love slept next to them, peaceful and in their own little dream world.
It is a great joy being able to unobtrusively observe a peace that is
completely independent from yourself. It's almost like a third person
perspective on your own joy, because that person is such a part of the
happy parts of your own life but at that moment they are detached from
the waking realities, such as being ill while on a stormy weathered
vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research online and figured that I probably had strep throat,
or a number of other more terrible things. The medicines I had been
taking were mostly ineffective, but not entirely. At least I had been
taking the recommended pain reliever, tylenol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had pho for breakfast at our dark alley pho place, which wasn't so
dark during daylight, and decided to go ahead and go to the Vinpearl
since we wanted to do something wonderful on this otherwise ruined trip
to Nha Trang. We went back to the hotel to pack up some things to take
and instead of going we fell asleep. When I woke up I had a fever of
probably about 102, which was just a guess compared to a measurement we
would take after getting a thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got online and told my bother about my sickness. Tien and I had
managed to take a decent photograph of my throat and I sent it to him.
Having been a medic in the Army stationed in Iraq he had seen plenty of
sore throats. He took one look at the photo and recommended penicillin
saying it was probably strep throat. The diagnosis was inconclusive
without a lab test, but he said that no matter what I was diagnosed with
they would put me on penicillin, so it didn't really matter what I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent Tien down to the local pharmacy to get some meds and she managed
to score some penicillin, which apparently is not a prescription drug in
Vietnam. She also got some of other recommended medicine and a
thermometer that we used to verify my fever. Needless to say we did not
go to the Vinpearl and instead spent the evening inside with Tien quiet
and worrying about me. I kept trying to make jokes and talk while she
was caring for me but she thought I was delirious from my fever and just
worried even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we both went to sleep, but having slept most of the day I was
unable to sleep the whole night. I woke up at 2:45 and couldn't sleep. I
took some more meds and found my temperature to be 100. I stayed up for
about an hour playing on my computer before I managed to become tired
enough to get back to sleep. Tien later told me that she had drifted
into consciousness and had seen me playing on the computer, but thought
it was a dream and went back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up the next morning it was 8am and I had no fever. After
breakfast we figured out our travel plans to return to Saigon and spent
the rest of the morning waiting for the train in our hotel room watching
Terminator. Tien had never seen it before and she was pretty intrigued
by it. I didn't go into the fact that the robot who had traveled back in
time to kill this woman was also the person who was running the state of
California where she would be living within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were checking out of our hotel the woman at the front desk
chatted with us a bit and asked me to bring a man back from America for
her. I chuckled, half out of politeness and half out of amusement that
so many people in Vietnam say things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a taxi to the train station and found that the train was delayed
over an hour. There wasn't much to do or eat at the train station so we
wandered down the street carrying our bags and found a restaurant that
looked good but ended up being pretty awful. I longed for yelp.vn so I
could write a bad review of the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4124076905/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue Train in Nha Trang" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2704/4124076905_717272aae1_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We returned to the train station and waited
some more. I went to use the bathroom and the mens room was unavailable.
The women's room had no light and there was a lot of liquid on the
floor, and who knows what else since it was dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally got on the train the first thing I noticed was that it
was pretty dirty. The seats were also pretty run down and rickety, but
were actually pretty comfortable. Once we started rolling it was great
though, so much more enjoyable than the bus. We didn't get many great
vistas, but we did pass a lot of beautiful landscape that I would love
to photograph. Some of the landscape looked like jungle, but there were
also mountains with rocks that reminded me of Colorado and Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played cards for a long time and listened to music. There was also
the standard television entertainment. I saw an ad for a slim TV that
was only like 18&amp;quot; thick and was amused. A few weeks later I would go to
a best buy with Dan Fava and find a television that was less than 2&amp;quot;
thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rolled slowly into Saigon that night and got a new view of city life
from the window of that train passing behind buildings, looking into
bars and apartments and restaurants that we hadn't seen before. I wished
I had a camera that was better at photographing in darkness because
there were some really awesome scenes visible from that window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired from our travels, we did the usual routine of finding a taxi to
drop us off at the Ruby Star.&lt;/p&gt;

previous day, and my throat hurt just a little bit worse. We spent the
morning laying around surfing the internet and being generally lazy. The
weather was still a little stormy too, pretty much exactly as it had
been the previous day. We had pho for breakfast at the same place we'd
gone the previous night, and would continue eating there almost
exclusively for the remainder of our stay in Nha Trang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;After breakfast we decided to take a walk down the beach to get some
fresh air and some sun. Tien was trying to convince me that mid-day
sunlight was terrible for you whereas morning and evening sunlight was
good for you. I tried to explain that sunlight is both good and bad
for you, depending on how much of it you get. I'm not really an
authority in that area though, so I suppose I could've been wrong, but
I'd never heard anything leading me to conclude that mid-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;day sun was worse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked down the beach the opposite direction and found a bunch of
wooden beach chairs under little wooden huts. We sat at one but were
quickly told that it cost 100k for a day to rent one, so we kept
walking. It began to rain lightly but with heavy wind, so we retreated
to a nearby gazebo where other people were doing the same. We sat there
for a while and the weather didn't relent, but luckily a woman came
wandering by trying to sell fruits. We somehow managed to get into an
argument about what fruits we were going to buy, I guess she thought we
could eat a whole pineapple along with 3 mangoes and countless other
fruits. Sometime I'm amazed at how easy it is for Vietnamese people to
make each other feel guilty for breaking agreements that were never even
made. In the end we got a good selection of fruit for a decent price, if
only because I had the money and I wasn't going to buy shit if she kept
trying to sell me fruit I didn't want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were sitting in the gazebo eating our fruit, another woman came by
trying to sell us cigarettes and all sorts of other things we didn't
want. She was persistent and stayed there a while. All of the sudden a
huge terrible breaking sound came from behind us. We turned around to
see a large coconut rolling across the grass away from large pieces of
broken tile. I would later learn that coconut injuries are more common
in Vietnam than auto injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was beginning to get fatigued again, and really irritated that I had
gotten sick in Nha Trang since we'd been waiting so long to get there.
We headed back to the hotel and laid around all day as I gobbled up
medicine and we both geeked out on the ever frustrating and intermittent
wifi we leeched from the hotel next door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having read a few articles in The Onion about National Awareness Month
and an article making fun of a man for defending what he believed the
constitution to be, I realized that I was pretty ignorant of what the
constitution really said and really a lot of other things that I'd grown
up believing that I had yet to verify. Generally I felt a lot like the
ignorant, misinformed people that irked me in political and religious
arguments. With nothing to do in the middle of the night, I decided to
go ahead and read the constitution. I didn't get very far into it
because I kept getting side-tracked reading context and related
information, but I must say that I did learn a lot and it was incredibly
eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got some dinner and slept away the night, and I was still frustrated
about being sick, hoping I'd be well the next day so Tien and I could
enjoy our vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

room all night and the next morning was very breezy. I spent a large
portion of the morning catching up on all the internet stuff I'd missed
during my offline stay in Mui Ne. Most notably, a 3D mandelbrot set had
been discovered and rendered into some impressive images. I also noticed
that I had exactly one week left in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling significantly more I'll that morning, but I thought I
might only have a sinus cold or something lame and trivial so I didn't
pay much attention to it, expecting that it would go away in a few days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cold water In our bathroom was broken so that only boiling hot water
came out of the shower until there was no more, then it went to only
cold water. This behavior would continue throughout our stay there,
requiring us to take cold shower baths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4114626370/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nha Trang waterfront from the Manchester Hotel" class="aligncenter" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2752/4114626370_ef6a563581.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 177px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got breakfast late that morning at the place directly next door to
The Manchester that I wouldn't recommend. Over breakfast Tien and I
talked a lot about humor and jokes. Even though there seem to be a lot
of differences between Vietnamese and American humor, there also seem to
be some global constants to humor. I tried to explain things like Knock
Knock jokes, one-liners, and other types of humor. Most jokes in
Vietnamese are longer jokes with a lot of context. This goes
hand-in-hand with their love for comedy theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we took a walk down the beach where it was incredibly
windy. It was nice though to be out in the sun. The wind wasn't cold
either and that was nice. The weather looked stormy though, the waves
were huge and the water was really rough, so I wasn't too hopeful about
getting to swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found our way back onto the sidewalk by the main road and passed an
area where there were about 50 large dragonflies hanging out. I thought
about photographing them, but didn't because I didn't have anything that
would make it easy to get a good shot. We also found many shops that
were selling seahorses, both alive and dead and in various containers.
Some were floating in liquid, some were dried and ready to be eaten
whole, and some were in fish tanks with nothing more than water. Tien
said that seahorses are supposed to have amazing medicinal functions,
just like eating live lizards. Lore is always a little humorous to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4186377527/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boats in Nha Trang" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2577/4186377527_9b734b10ac_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The destination on our walk was a place called the
Vinpearl, and it was amazingly difficult to walk there. We actually had
to walk beyond it over a hill and then come around back to it, winding
in the roads of its campus that had no sidewalks. Clearly this place was
made to be traveled to and from by motor vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vinpearl is actually a huge island theme park with a lot of
attractions. We didn't know this when we set out to go there, but
discovered it when we arrived at the mainland side of a gondola that
takes people to and from the island. There were also boats of various
size that would ferry people back and forth. I was feeling pretty tired
from my illness and the walk and didn't feel like I had the energy for a
theme park, so we opted to go back another day and instead spend our day
on the mainland. We intended to visit an aquarium, but when we got into
the taxi and told him to take us there he said it was on the Vinpearl
island. This was another mistake of not doing research and not using the
guidebook. I'm never going anywhere without the guidebook again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4236624600/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tien at Ponagar" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4236624600_fb4603cdbd_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Instead of going to the aquarium we went to a place
called Ponagar Tower that was an ancient stone temple. It was a bit like
something you'd find at Angkor Wat. It was a small temple but Tien
enjoyed it much. There was an older Japanese man doing tricks with tops,
swords and yo-yo's on the upper landing of the complex. He was pretty
funny, partly because he kept messing up. He would say everything in
Japanese and there was a translator and a few drum players beating on
tribal drums for dramatic effect as he did things like accidentally
throwing a top larger than my head, nearly hitting a bystander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling increasingly ill and tired so we headed back to The
Manchester for a nap. I was developing some flu like symptoms like fever
and sore throat, so I assumed that's what it was. We went for dinner and
found an absolutely delicious pho place at the end of a dark alley and
conveniently near a pharmacist. We had our dinner and picked up a
cocktail of medication for my symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

dunes that were about 20km north. We got breakfast at a place just up
the road on our way. There was a modeling show on TV and I was watching
it to see what gear the photographers were using. They were interviewing
the models a lot and I wondered what they were talking about. I guessed
that the show was in English, but the sound was down and drown out by
really loud Vietnamese music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4160465027/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tiny Trees" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2561/4160465027_1a2af87986_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Over breakfast we talked about our plans and decided to go
straight to Nha Trang instead of stopping along the way at some temples.
Tien wasn't excited about our bad luck finding things to do in Mui Ne,
and since the second place we had planned to go was pretty remote she
expected it to be much of the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the road, we headed off into unexplored territory that looked
not much like what I'd seen in Vietnam before. I caught the scent of a
Colorado summer in the air. We saw a lot of farm animals, including
geese that were hanging out with cows and goats and water buffalo. We
passed by a lot of sand and the landscape turned into rolling hills with
trees scattered around it, much like the high Colorado prairies.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4160502783/"&gt;&lt;img alt="At the lake's edge" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4160502783_3bf33db960_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 164px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The road turned into dirt and sand mixed together and
the motorbike became a bit wobbly because of the sand shifting under the
bald tires. We could see the white sands in the distance on the far side
of a lake by a small forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually made it to a spot where a few motorbikes and jeeps were
valeted at a little shack, so we did the same and began walking through
some trees next to the lake that was at the foot of the white sands,
through some shops, past some other tourists and up towards the sand
dunes. A kid followed us much like the two from the night before, asking
us to rent his sled and pointing things out to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4160490007/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tien at White Sands" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2500/4160490007_cdeafc388a_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We walked around a bit, but sand is sand so there
wasn't really much to see. We took some photos and the kid kept asking
if we wanted him to take our picture. Eventually I conceded, thinking he
might charge us for it. He took two, then had us stand somewhere else
and took two more. When I looked at them I was very pleasantly surprised
at his composition, each pose taking one wide and one close shot. I
tipped him a few thousand dong and we headed back to our bike. He
trailed behind and complained endlessly in Vietnamese that the money I
gave him wasn't clean enough and he wouldn't be able to use it to buy
cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien had driven on the way out so I got to drive on the way home. This
was my first time in like 12 years riding a motorcycle on dirt. We
quickly sank our rear tire in a spot where I had gotten off to walk
before. We both laughed and Tien got off so I could wobble my way up out
of the sand and across to where the dirt was solid again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we headed back the way we came, over the rolling hills and through a
pretty countryside I thought again about buying a motorcycle one of
these days so we could just cruise the countryside at our own pace, not
having to rely on buses. I also changed my mind about Mui Ne being a
lame place to go, it's pretty nice outside of town in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4160465023/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Resting in oceanic peace" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2502/4160465023_96d668a5d8_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a herd of cattle that had been
grazing in a field where there were many graves marked with swastikas, a
symbol of power and not of Nazi affiliation, and now these cattle were
taking up the whole road. I squeezed by and then stopped and watched a
big truck make its way by, something I wasn't sure would be easy for it
to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived back at the hotel we returned the bike, packed and
checked out, but our bus wasn't coming for two hours. There was a warm
breeze coming in through large open windows and blowing around the
chandeliers in the lobby where the Internet was still broken. Tien and I
decided to go wait by the beach. There were no hammocks, which was a
disappointment, but we found a little table to sit at and enjoy some
drinks while playing cards with the ocean waves breaking about 50 feet
away. Tien kicked my ass at the game I had taught her, I only won twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4161468110/"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2524/4161468110_32d9f0c6aa_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 173px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We got one last meal in Mui Ne, then went upstairs to wait for
the bus. I explained photographic composition and exposure to Tien while
we were waiting, but had to finish the discussion on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exhausting the topic of photography I realized I forgot my
headphones in my backpack which was stored in the cargo area. This was a
pretty bad thing to do since I was then forced to endure the most epic
movie I'd ever seen and then hours of loud Vietnamese theatrical comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus had headed north beyond the white sand dunes, introducing us to
even more beautiful countryside and coastline. The bus was comfortable
too so it was an enjoyable ride. We even stopped for 15 minutes at the
first rest stop I'd seen that had Internet access. My iPhone GPS worked
too, which kinda made sense because we were near Da Lat and it had
worked there. It continued to work as we headed north and I wondered if
the norh of Vietnam had the mobile infrastructure to accommodate the
retarded assisted GPS in the iPhone. After all, my phone hadn't been
unlocked when I was in Hanoi, so I wasn't sure it didn't work there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began to rain right at dusk. I also began to feel sick in my throat.
I had been feeling a few symptoms once in a while for the past day or
so, but this was the first real evidence that I was coming down with
something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to Nha Trang it was still raining lightly. As I was getting
into a hotel shuttle I noticed a motorbike stashed in the cargo area of
a bus, a brilliant idea that I wouldn't have expected to be permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked into a hotel that I'd seen reviewed somewhere online, The
Manchester. Our room was on the sixth floor with an ocean view and
deplorable wifi access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our walk to find dinner, just when I thought we'd gone the wrong way
from restaurants we came across an authentic Italian restaurant where
two men were talking loudly in Italian. After sitting down an older
Italian man, the cook, came out to introduce the specials and show us
the list of Italian wines. I got the chefs special and as I sipped my
wine I pulled out my iPhone and found an Actiontec wireless network. It
almost felt like we were sitting in Sunnyvale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to take a shower, and upon increasing the &amp;quot;heat&amp;quot; dial on the
electric hot water heater that was attached to the shower, the light in
the bathroom flickered and went out. In the pitch black with my hand
still on the dial, I decreased the temp and the light flickered back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4119793574/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fishing Boat" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2695/4119793574_803b5b8d37_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After showering I got dressed I poked my head out the
front door of our room and some mysteries from the previous night were
unraveled. Beyond some local fishermen taking their nets out of the
circular boats and emptying them there were many boats anchored not far
out in the ocean. Two guys on a motorbike rode down the beach and parked
near the fishermen. I wanted to ride a motorcycle on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went to get breakfast, which was supposed to be included in
the price of our hotel. On the way we passed some older Vietnamese men
with a lot of missing teeth who were drinking beer and eating crabs for
their breakfast. We also saw some chained up monkeys, a golden lizard
that I was not familiar with, and a dozen small dogs. We found our way
to the large dining area of the hotel restaurant. It was an open walled
lodge type of building with a tall peaked roof and only one of the 50 or
so tables was occupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the resort interrupted our conversation to sit with us
while we were waiting for breakfast. He had much the same character as
the sleazy guy on the bus the previous night and the guy we stayed with
in Binh Duong. Later Tien and I would talk about how many of the
Vietnamese men who go to America and come back have this very haughty
attitude, and she would express her hopes of not becoming like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bread was stale, the food was bland, and the price was not included
with our room. Bien Nam was probably the worst deal I've ever gotten on
a room, and I do not recommend it to anybody who is going to Mui Ne.
With that in mind we went for a walk on the beach which we now saw was
home to many other hotels. We walked along the beach, stopping at each
to inquire about vacancy, price, wifi and to see a room. There were
varying qualities of hotels and we settled on one that had wifi in the
lobby, a friendly staff, a much cleaner room, a halfway decent view of
the ocean, and for 25% less per night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were walking along the beach there were numerous jet ski's parked
on the shore. I hadn't seen a jet ski in Asia except on the river in
Thailand, and wondered why because they're so speedy and nimble, the
aquatic equivalent of the ubiquitous motorbike. Here they were on the
Pacific Ocean being used for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked out of our old hotel without so much as a word from the owner
asking us why we were leaving or asking us to stay and I thought that he
was probably used to having one-night guests. We checked into our new
hotel and took a nap. Tien was sleepy, but I was not, so after a few
minutes of restless napping I got up and shaved my face and head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tien finally got up we were both pretty hungry, so we decided to go
to town. We stopped by the lobby to return our key and I played on their
wifi just enough to discover that they had a wireless with no connection
to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out front to try to wave down somebody to give us a ride into
town. Not many people were passing by, and most already had passengers,
so I thought we might as well walk down the road while trying to hitch a
ride. It was remarkable though that I had been asked innumerable times
before if I needed a motorbike when I did not, and here I was without
one in sight. It wasn't like Malaysia either where a taxi mysteriously
appeared from behind a building just when we needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked for a while and found some guys sitting in front of a hotel
with some motorbikes there. Tien talked to one of them and he said he
could find another person so we could both ride into town for 25k each.
Just after he left to go find another motorbike rider willing to give us
a ride, the valet told Tien that we could probably rent a motorbike for
the day for not much more than 50k. A second man on a motorbike came by,
then the first man came back with a third guy on a motorbike and what
ensued was a long bickering argument about how we needed to rent from
the guys we first spoke to even though they were not going to allow me
to ride their bike, which was something we wanted. In the end I said
&amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot; and we left the three stubborn motorcyclists there and started
walking down the road again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked for a while and it was actually pretty nice to use my body,
something I'm so used to doing in the USA but don't get much chance to
here in Asia. There were beautiful trees with flowering leaves, and the
ocean was visible through a thin line of trees between the road and the
beach. Eventually the second motorcyclist from the argument came up to
us on the road, talked to Tien for a while and we agreed to rent his
bike for a day for 180k. I'd never driven a manual without a clutch
though, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do so without first watching
Tien. As soon as she took off down the road I realized that it was just
like riding an auto except you could kick a pedal to change gears
without worrying about the clutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4119793578/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Flat Tire in Mui Ne" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2657/4119793578_9b79270290_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Renting the bike was a great idea. We were now
cruising down Highway 1 of Vietnam right by the ocean with warm air on
our face on our way to find food for our hungry bellies. We passed a
herd of water buffalo and a bunch of people who were drying fish on
screens and then found ourselves at a dead end. We were lost again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wandered around some coastal villages, finding several dead ends, and
were just about to make some progress on finding our way to town when we
got a flat tire. Obviously this was incredibly lame since I was hungry
and it wasn't our bike anyway, but at least there was a moto shop right
there where we had it repaired within 30 minutes. We had to buy a new
tube and kept the old one as well as the contact information of the shop
who did the work. I also took some photographs, but mainly because
that's what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our new tire and some instructions on how to get to town, we headed
off still in search of food for our bellies. I honestly was beyond the
point of hungry and didn't care much anymore, though I knew I should
eat. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4118095459/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mui Ne Palms" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2633/4118095459_9187c931c8_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We rode and rode and rode. We saw a lot of cool
things, like the harbor where most of the boats anchor, some cool
buildings, forests, animals, but amazingly we couldn't find a
restaurant. We passed all the way through town and out to where the
sizzler was, though we never did find that, and all we saw along the way
were cafes with snacks, but no real food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a sign for The Mui Ne Easy Riders that said &amp;quot;I'll show things
the lonely planet did not.&amp;quot; I thought that was awesome, and it was
accompanied with pictures of Vietnamese bikers on proper motorcycles
geared up with luggage and white people on the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went all the way back through town and found ourselves lost at the
first dead end we had found, which was a kite surfing camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we gave up and went to get some gasoline and as dumb luck would
have it, we found a restaurant. Too tired and frustrated to show our
joy, we pulled over, ordered some food and drinks, and were promptly
attacked by about 50 flies. I'd never seen a place with so many flies. I
ordered a beer and the man went and pulled the bottle out of a crate of
empty bottles, a hat, a helmet and other miscellaneous things. When I
was done with my beer I set the glass down there were like 15 flies
crawling all over it within 30 seconds. It was probably due to all the
dead fish, since we were in a fishing village. We got our food to go
because the flies were too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the hotel we stopped to get a hot dog, which is not
the same as it is in America. In Vietnam a hot dog is some kind of
triangular crepe thing with no meat in it. We took a different route
home and found ourselves riding along a big field of sand and trees
where kids were jumping into the sand the same way I did when I was
their age. We found our way up the big roads and vacant round-a-bout
from the night before and were soon cruising that beautiful section of
the coast again. The day was beautiful, the ocean was beautiful, I had
my fiancé with me, I had hot food to put in my belly, and we weren't
lost. I was happy. So happy I had Tien stop so I could take her photo.
As I was composing my shot a used trash bag blew up against my leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4112447186/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cruising Highway 1, Vietnam" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2734/4112447186_d04b0a3863_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Back at the hotel we sat on our bed and
watched the ocean beyond the tin roof cabana where nobody was sitting.
Since it was so late, just about sunset, the heat had worn off, so we
decided to go back to the sand dune park nearby and have a look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children greeted us with sleds for rent to slide down the sand dunes. We
valeted the bike and started hiking up the dunes. Two kids followed us
trying to rent us a sled for 30k, which we were not interested in. There
were a lot of other people there watching the sunset, even many white
people. I always try to smile and nod a greeting to other travelers as I
pass them if it's appropriate, and it always amazes me how white people
don't want to talk to each other or acknowledge each other's existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before heading home we got some snacks and a deck of cards. Back at the
hotel the internet was still down and they didn't know why. I knew why
though. It was misconfigured and was getting no responses to its DHCP
queries. It probably needed PPPoE, but those settings were not
remembered in the firmware, which means it may have been hard reset as a
last ditch attempt to fix what is probably an unreliable DSL connection.
I hate DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the hotel room Tien washed our clothes and we hung them to dry
on a rope that I brought to use for just such an occasion, then I taught
her how to play a card game that I know but don't know what it's called.&lt;/p&gt;

stiff ankles. I thought about how I should probably stay more active to
avoid that displeasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after waking up Tien called a bus service and found a bus going to
Saigon at 9:30. Thu got us some hot breakfast from the market while we
packed. We ate and headed off by bus. We were still unsure about the
train schedule and availability and decided just to head to a travel
agency in Pham Ngu Lao and see what we could find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were leaving Binh Hoa I saw a scooter stacked 4 boxes high that
had fallen over while parked and the driver was trying to pick it back
up. A peloton of cyclists passed by. Real cyclists, not just school kids
on their way. We did pass a school though and I noticed that all schools
in Vietnam look the same. Tan buildings with big fences and blue signs
with white text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got to Saigon I noticed some large text written with plants on a
wall. As we passed I looked back at it and saw it was a billboard wall
made with an array of pot holders so you could use pots containing
different colored plants to make patterns. Potted plant pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clouds were dark and it began to rain. I feared bad weather or
worse, really bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed a police checkpoint set up at the side of the road. I had also
seen one as we were entering Long Xuyen and I would see another as we
were leaving Saigon. I never found out what the story was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after getting into a taxi I saw a guy on a motorbike with no helmet
and a styled Asian hairdo with the addition of a mullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw two young girls on a scooter collide with a woman carrying baskets
on each side of her handlebars in busy Saigon traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a guy on a motorbike sharing headphones with his passenger the way
Tien and I do. I'd never seen anybody else wearing headphones while
riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our taxi turned down Nguyen Trai street, home of the Ruby Star, and we
drove for many, many blocks. There were tons of stores full of awesome
girl clothes and I thought about how if I was a girl I'd go nuts in a
place like that. For a man of my style and stature there is neither the
inclination nor the option for such an occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving at the same travel agency where the two motorbike taxis
had dropped us off at last time, Tien and I quickly figured out our
travel situation, bought bus tickets and went to find coffee. We only
had to go next door to Highland Coffee. We had eaten lunch here before,
it was the cafe where the French club owner was negotiating with the
local DJs. The food was good here but we just wanted coffee. It had
western prices but with them, western flavor, which was very welcome. I
had savored a cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed there for an hour while I caught up on some internet stuff and
charged my phone whose battery had been depleted while playing
Fieldrunners on the bus, then went outside and boarded our bus to Mui
Ne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were very few people on the bus and about half of us were white,
though not all speaking English. Most were a group of three girls and
one guy who I thought were Ukrainian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we headed north there was a variety show on the TV with guy and girl
hosts who I recognized. Tien said the man's name was Nguyen Ngoc Ngan,
which may not sound like you think but is still pretty hard to
pronounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of songs sung between guys and girls reaching
dramatically out into the air and gazing at each other during the
harmonies and looking away during the solos. I asked Tien why so many
Vietnamese people like this kind of thing and she just laughed and said
it was romantic. I asked why Vietnamese people like romance so much and
she didn't know. It seemed odd for a conservative culture to be so
enamored with romance. I thought that as far as video media is
concerned, romance was to Vietnamese people what action is to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit later two Vietnamese people got on, one guy and one girl, and
immediately struck up a conversation in English with the Europeans. They
both spoke english very comfortably and phrases such as &amp;quot;you know, like&amp;quot;
made it clear they had lived in America for a while. The man said he was
engaged, though not to the girl he was with, then continued to flirt
with the Norwegian girls, a detail I garnished from unwilling
eavesdropping. He talked on about money and living in America, and it
even seemed like his girl friend was being his wingman. For a while I
thought he might just be the guy we stayed with in Binh Duong. He was
certainly just as sleazy with all the same lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bus employees came by asking where to drop us off, but we
really didn't know because we hadn't planned that far ahead. The man in
front of us said he could recommend a cheap hotel to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put my headphones back on and we lost ourselves in a variety of music
that I picked while scanning the songs. Debussy, The Thompson Twins,
Oscar Peterson, Simply Red, Zero 7, Above and Beyond. We settled on
classical and I drifted off for a few songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up we were slowing down next to the ocean to let the
Norwegians off. There was a sizzler restaurant and a wind surfing and
scuba diving tour place. We rode a little farther and got off where the
man who was recommending our hotel got off. A guy on a motorbike was
waiting for a fare, and he flagged down another passing motorbike to
take us to a hotel. As we were riding Tien's driver talked on and on and
on in Vietnamese. We left town and headed inland a bit, which wasn't
encouraging because I wanted to be in the city or at least by the water.
We took some big roads, passed an empty round-about by some big sand
dunes, and eventually popped back out onto a highway that paralleled a
beautiful beach. I could see the caps of breaking waves in the darkness.
The air was warm, and it was magical riding along the coast through that
warm night air on a motorbike next to Tien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien's driver led us to a dark resort hotel with trees scattered between
various buildings. Tien later told me that he had skipped the hotel that
the man had recommended because it was apparently too loud and was a
dirty place. I honestly couldn't imagine what a hotel was that was
dirtier than the place he took us to. It had water stains on the wall,
chipped plaster, it smelled funky, there was a board covering the window
in the bathroom, and it looked pretty much like it wasn't kept up very
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked in and agreed to pay 400k a night, which was clearly too much
for what we were getting. We had come so far out of town and hadn't
passed anywhere that was definitely open that I figured the price to
take the motorbikes elsewhere would've been more than the difference, so
I decided to go ahead and take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after checking in we went 50 feet down to the beach where there
were lots of red and blue lights bobbing in the dark ocean. We couldn't
tell what they were, though it was clear some of them were boats because
a few times somebody turned on a flashlight and shined it around the
boat they were standing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some circular boats that looked like baskets sitting on
the shore. Somebody was busy filling one of them up with some kind of
supplies as if they were about to go out into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sand was coarse and the water seemed a little dirty, so with that
and the fact that I was tired we decided against swimming or even
staying at the beach and returned to our room for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

Tien and I were still recovering from our motorbike trips and I swore
off ever going long distances on Tien's scooter ever again. We did,
however, plan to head north from Saigon to Mui Ne and Nha Trang the
following day by bus, and hopefully also by train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed around the house all day, but that evening we went for a ride
around town at sunset. I brought my camera gear and photographed some
boats in the river. We turned this way and that while riding through her
village, going along waterways and over bridges, waving to the folks on
the boats I was photographing and to the locals we passed who beamed at
the sight of a white guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before dusk I spotted a big rice paddie that hadn't been
harvested, the same one I had photographed tien at a few days earlier
but on the opposite, remote side. There are so few places in Tien's
village where you can get right next to the rice paddies and I was
excited to find such a great spot. On top of that, Tien said she had
never been there. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4116222967/"&gt;&lt;img alt="We found ourselves here" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/4116222967_05fa06be29_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was happy to have shown
tien a beautiful new place in her own village. Unfortunately the light
was dark and I had no tripod so I couldn't take the photos I wanted, but
I did the best I could. We sat a minute and enjoyed the vast green
before us, then turned on our dirt path and headed back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This neighborhood was distinctly different from most of the places she
had taken me. It was pretty hard to get to and far from the main roads.
Most of the houses had open front walls, giving you full view into the
living rooms where people were watching TV, playing with their kids,
praying. Many of the houses had only a fence, not hard steel locking
gate. Some had only glass windows on a locking door. I liked this
neighborhood, it was like a tiny remote village tucked just 1km off the
main road.&lt;/p&gt;

which only lasts the morning. When we fetched our motorbike from the
valet there was a tiny blob of bird crap on my seat. Only after trying
to flick it off and getting it on my fingernails did I consider bird
flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gassed up the motorbike on the way to breakfast. All of the gas
station in Vietnam are full service, but this was the first time I
noticed that their pumps are configured to turn off at 20k dong and
every 10k afterwards, making it easy for them to count without looking
as they fill numerous bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cruised through the city and through more construction. Bridges are
the most common project after new buildings. I wished that I had a
compass so I could better know where I was. I wished I had an iPhone 3gs
and considered the idea of leaving my 3g with Tien. I thought maybe it
wouldn't be good to force her into an Apple world where Apple had such
little penetration and thought about other smart phones, like the Droid,
and contiuned down a line of thinking that many technologists have gone
down where they end up damning the circularly innovating companies like
Nokia and Motorola who have been busy doing nothing remarkable until
Apple lit a fire under their ass by releasing the iPhone. Now everybody
is releasing new platforms for smart phones that sync data (omg what an
idea), have real browsers and email, and have standard platforms for app
development (no thanks to Sun and Java here either.) I then continued by
damning every carrier who locked their customers into contracts with a
particular network and no way to get a device outside that network.
iPhone, droid, pre... Three new smart phones, all locked to their
providers. I silently thanked the hackers for breaking through this
asinine misbehavior and allowing us to actually use the devices we have
paid for. I still had no compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At breakfast I ordered eggs with bread and iced coffee and proceeded to
burn myself on the platter my eggs were served in, then ate the peppers
that were in the pan with my eggs. This day was not off to a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought a lot about Colorado. I had decided to go back to Colorado for
December to see my family and stay with my brother now that he's out of
the army and back in America and was really excited about it. It had
been a long time since I'd spent a good chunk of time there, and I
hadn't spent much time with my brother in years. Hiking and video
gaming, here we come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We scooted on over to the market and found ourselves on a road running
parallel to the river. We stopped so I could take some photos of the
floating market and a guy who was loading watermelon into a boat offered
to ride us around the market for 100k. I thought that might be a little
steep, especially since he was on his way out anyways. Tien didn't want
to go with him because he didn't have any life jackets. Even after I
pointed out that he was an experienced captain and that there was a
whole river full of boats that people were busy not falling out of she
still didn't agree so we went back to the corner market, valeted the
bike and hired a boat with life jackets for 100k. These life jackets sat
untouched and barely noticed at the front of the boat for the duration
of our voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4112447194/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mango Captain" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2794/4112447194_ffbc4a4516_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It was just Tien and I with the captain as we cruised up
and back down the river through innumerable boats exchanging fruits and
vegetables. There were a few common styles of boats, most being the big
junkers that were anchored to each other and the riverbed. Most people
in junkers would sit with some of their goods on top of the cabin
waiting for somebody to come by. They had bamboo poles sticking up off
of their boat with example fruits tied to them so people could spot what
was available at a glance while passing by. Some people were cruising
around in smaller ferrying goods from here to there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4114595589/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Local transport onboard" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/4114595589_3c7a0d10ee_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sometimes we would be right next to the other
boats and sometimes we would be far away. I kept switching between my
10-20mm lens and my 50mm, wishing I had an 18-55mm or a second body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many other tourists, some in large tour groups and some with
privately rented boats like ours. I saw a slightly heavy slightly
balding white guy with an SLR on the back of a boat taking a lot of
photos and thought I probably looked just like that. I watched my other
self for a while and didn't care much for how I looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were pulling back into port our captain gently and accidentally
ran the boat into a brick wall sticking out from the steps leading I to
the water. He looked back and laughed then corrected his parking job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the market we found a place to get some drinks. I got a fresh
sugar cane drink that was delicious. We sat and enjoyed the drinks for a
while and I thought again about smart phones and realized that the
iPhone doesn't have a Vietnamese keyboard layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't stay at the market long and opted instead to cruise the city.
After having been the driver in Da Lat and the fact that my ass hurt so
bad sitting on that seat, I really disliked being a passenger. I was
missing the five contact points of a bicycle, having really only one
since the motorbike was too small for the foot pegs to do me much
good.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4114340011/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Defiant" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2539/4114340011_4f71269620_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I tried to enjoy the ride while looking at the river,
some parks and all the local daily things, but I was honestly really
happy to return to the hotel for a rest before starting the journey
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grabbed lunch at the restaurant that we had intended to visit the
night before and then began our long and painful ride north under the
mid day sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a John Deere sign and wondered how much business they got in the
Mekong where so much of the work was done by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A steam roller came driving down the road going the opposite direction.
Apparently in Vietnam they redo the roads while still letting people
drive on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billowing clouds in the sky reminded me of that song &amp;quot;little fluffy
clouds&amp;quot;, which I first heard incorrectly as being by Orbital, and I
decided to put them on my iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one and a half orbital albums we stopped to take a break. We
looked in vain for a place with wifi and decided to settle for hammocks
instead. Laying there with an ice cold drink, staring up at the ceiling
of our wooden hut, tien asked me if I knew about those kinds of houses.
She told me that the roof was made of coconut leaves and said that when
she was a little girl her family lived in a house made that way. That
was amazing for me to think about, having come from living in a house
made from bamboo and coconut leaves to now, and the unknown future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I paid for our drinks I realized that Ho Chi Minh was on all the
bills in Vietnam. I wondered why it was that only this one man was so
important and how that had steered the Vietnamese culture.&lt;/p&gt;

was definitely bruised in a few places and the cut was dry. My sandals
are pretty soft though and did a great job of easing the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the market for breakfast Tien and I discussed plans to go to Can
Tho, a city located a few hours south by motorbike and home to a famous
floating market on the river, and to Nha Trang. We decided to go to Can
Tho that evening and Nha Trang that weekend or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thu came around with some mangos and a durian. The durian looked like
some kind of organ inside, an alien brain dreamed up by H R Giger. They
made me try the durian, otherwise known around the western world as
&amp;quot;stinky fruit.&amp;quot; it was very strange with several successive flavors and
a distinct after taste that unfortunately lasts for hours even when
chased with a fresh mango.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon I rained on and off, sometimes very hard, and Mai
suggested that we not go to Can Tho that night. We did though, waiting
for what looked like clear skies and a bit later than we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roads were worse than I expected. Tien had said it would take three
hours when I said it would probably take two. She was right though, of
course, because she lived there briefly while taking classes at the
local college. The sunset was gorgeous with big billowing clouds in the
far distance. Darkness set in about halfway there, but it didn't rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed through a lot of construction, of course. There was a large
building that looked finished with a balcony on the second floor that
stuck out over the entryway. The third floor stuck out above the inside
of the balcony, shading it from the elements and there were no doors
between the balcony and the inside. Vietnam is the kind of place where
it's never so cold you have to turn on a heater. The floors are made
from tile and withstand the elements and human abuse, so you don't
always need windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride seemed to stretch on forever and my ass began to hurt badly.
Later I would discover bruises back there on the bones and tissue, and
would then decide never to take a long trip on Tien's motorbike ever
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got to Can Tho I noticed two things that set it apart from other
places we'd been. First, there were numerous Christian churches, which
is very rare in Vietnam. Usually there will be one church and buddhist
shrines and temples everywhere. This was probably the first time I'd
seen several in a row and it was reminiscent of the USA and it's
competitive divisions of Christianity. The other thing I noticed was
more progressive fashion that seemed to have a purpose or theme outside
the normal engrish phrases. There was a sense of brand style in some of
the shops rather than the free for all found most of the other places
I've been. The only other place I'd really seen this in Vietnam was the
westernized shops in Saigon that were sometimes even owned by the brand,
like Dr. Marten's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rode down main street and turned off a few side roads searching for a
hotel. By this time Tien was doing most of the searching and I was busy
trying to find an unbruised part of my back side to sit on. Eventually
we found a hotel for $15 and took it. We went upstairs with the
intention of resting for a while before heading back out to a place Tien
used to eat, but we didn't make it back out until the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

there, so we had planned to wake up at 5am. I rarely sleep well before
having to wake up early, and this was no different. I wasn't watching
the clock though, since that doesn't help you sleep, and so we overslept
a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were all up I packed my camera and water into a backpack. I wore
zip-off synthetic pants that dry quickly, the perfect thing for long
exposure to sun but still good for swimming and hiking. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4101777381/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Breakfast at the Binh Hoa market" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2481/4101777381_ddac20d2da_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was the only one who was really dressed for
hiking though... Tien, Thu and Mai looked more like they were going
shopping, and I wondered if we would actually do any hiking at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got breakfast at a stall in the market on our way out. I got to watch
the woman make the hu tieu, which is just pho with different noodles.
That was kinda neat, I always wondered how that process worked. The
magic is the soup in a huge pot. There were flies everywhere at the
stall, landing on the meat and vegetables. When the woman sitting next
to me paid she got her change returned to her right on the noodles that
were going to be used to make people's food. I've never worked in a
restaurant, but I'm pretty sure flies on the meat and dirty money on the
ingredients wouldn't fly in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I headed off on her bike with her sisters following. I had the
headphone splitter connected to my iPod so Tien and I both got two
earbuds to listen to the new Late Night Alumni album that had come out
the previous day or so. We took a dirt back road out of her village, one
that we'd passed but hadn't taken before. It was neat to see what was
back there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A waterway ran between two dirt roads on each shore that were almost big
enough for a car. There were people fishing on little canoes and rickety
wooden docks. A man squatted next to the river smoking a cigarette.
People with bicycle powered stands for bread and yogurt pedaled by on
their way to the main streets of the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We turned onto the main road that buses and big trucks used to transport
big loads between Chau Doc and Long Xuyen. A little naked boy was
playing with a stick on a brick wall a few feet from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that many of the motorbikes only had a hand brake on the right
handle and wondered why this was. I thought at first they only had a
front brake, but saw that they did have a back brake. I thought that
maybe the one handle operated both brakes, which is uncommon in America
but might have been more common in a place where motorbikes were as
plentiful as cars in America. It certainly allowed people to have a free
left hand for talking on cell phones, which they did. I later realized
that I had thrown out the idea of a foot brake when thinking about
automatic transmission scooters, and that the rear brake was where it
should be, on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a man with his canoe dry docked at the side of the road as he
repaired leaks in the bottom of it. I wondered how common it was for
them to sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Late Night Alumni was done I put on Squirrel Nut Zippers and the
song Good Enough for Granddad came on. It was probably my first time
hearing it and it made me happy thinking about how my grandfather, who I
never knew, traveled all over the world and was a happy man, and here I
was traveling and happy too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4101761403/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Out in the country" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2702/4101761403_9c95816128_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We stopped at a village market to buy some things
to take up Mt. Cam to a friend of Tien's family. A man came by selling
lottery tickets holding a small boy with no legs. At first I was sad
that the boy had no legs, but then I thought about the NOFX song Nubs
and thought that disabled people are just like every other person.
Everybody has their problems and everybody can be happy. Disability
isn't something to rejoice in, but it's not something to wallow in
either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached Mt. Cam we passed several temples that looked like
something you'd see in Thailand or Cambodia. There was writing in an
alphabet that was like Thai or Khmer, which I can't really distinguish,
especially when they're written ornately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at the foot of the mountain after paying to enter the park
and rested for a bit. I was wondering where we'd start hiking from, and
then I began to wonder if we'd hike at all. Just like last time, guys on
motorcycles were following us around talking and talking and talking. We
ended up hiring them to take us to the top of the mountain and then we
would walk back down, an idea I wasn't completely happy with. As long as
I got to hike though I'd be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got on the back of a bike with squeaky brakes and a broken speedometer
and we headed up the steep incline that cuts across the side of Mt. Cam.
Looking back, the green fields that stretched to the horizon last time I
was here were replaced by endless pools of water cut into lines by rows
of trees, as if the whole country was flooded. The country wasn't
flooded though. It's always under water like this, you just can't see it
below the blades of rice leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4101943061/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Monking around Mt. Cam Temple" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/4101943061_336e2c365f_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 183px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the top, we went to the temple. Two
boys met us and sold us some incense and began walking with us. Tien and
Thu went inside to pray and I wanted in the bottom of the pagoda with
Mai. When Tien and Thu returned we went onto the lawn by the pagoda,
spread out a rain jacket and had a little picnic lunch. They had brought
beer, 7up, bread, meat, soy sauce, fruits, chop sticks and sliced
vegetables. We sat there and ate our lunch, throwing scraps of meat to
the temple dogs that came wandering by. The two boys hung around,
climbing on the handrail of the pagoda and chasing the bigger dogs away.
Thu gave them some money and told them to get us some ice and cups for
our drinks, and when they returned she gave them each an apple. I showed
them some juggling with some rambutans and contact juggled their apples.
They were happy boys that talked a lot. They had dark skin, probably
from being outside all the time. Tien said that they would show us the
way to a waterfall where we could swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we took off walking and the motorbike brigade swarmed around
us again. Tien asked if we should take the motorbikes or hike, and since
I was set on hiking I said we should hike and continued doing so. The
girls straggled as the boy and I walked ahead, and eventually Tien
decided to get the motorbikes to take us to the trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought we would lose the boy in the motorcycle exchange, but he
managed to get on one of the bikes and was there at the trailhead
leading the way down into the forest. He and I continued to set the pace
down the trail while the girls walked behind us. The trail was a well
traveled trail, maintained with steps leading down and trash everywhere.
It ended up being more like a sidewalk through a stretched out village
with stores scattered along the trail and people living in houses by the
stores, just like any other Vietnamese village. People were rebuilding
their stores, redoing the cement on the sidewalk, napping in hammocks,
watching TV, and there were even a few old beggars singing songs at the
side of the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy to be hiking. I could sometimes hear the creek in the forest
to our right. The boy kept on talking as if I understood him. Tien said
he was talking to me, saying things like &amp;quot;keep going, sir&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;just
this way, sir.&amp;quot; Eventually he led us to a cascading waterfall with large
rocks where people had built homes and stores next to. There were
statues of rabbits and other animals, and a little heart at the edge of
a rock. There was also a steep waterfall at the bottom and a few wires
that you could use to attempt to save your own life with should you slip
and slide towards your demise. We went away from that part to a higher
area where there were two pools separated by a waterfall going down the
side of a large rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4095472454/"&gt;&lt;img alt="She came in with all her clothes on" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2619/4095472454_bbc76577ff_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 177px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As I was the only one dressed for
hiking, so was I the only one dressed for swimming, but nonetheless Tien
rolled up her pants unnecessarily and waded into the water up to her
waist. We spent a long while playing in the water, taking pictures and
having fun. I fell down the waterfall bruising my foot and palm and
gashing a hole in my left heel, but I didn't care much. I just had the
boy fetch me a beer and drank it while sitting in the pool of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we were rested and cooled off we headed down the trail once again.
There were lots of dogs along the way, and lots of puppies. I saw a
rooster eating off the counter in an open kitchen. We soon stopped again
where some men were reclining in hammocks watching football. When I say
&amp;quot;football&amp;quot; I mean what Americans call soccer. America seems to be the
only country that doesn't call it football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sat at a table and a happy woman brought me iced coffee. Tien asked
her for some bandaids for my barely bleeding foot. I migrated to a
hammock for a while and everybody thought I would break it. A while
later the woman invited us into her home. We went with her to the back
where her house met the waterfalls and sat on the rocks eating
grapefruit and looking out over the tree tops at the infinite pool of
water stretching beyond the mountain to the horizon. It was a nice home,
and her family was nice. Her son was a monk from the temple on top of
the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while of sitting and eating we bid them farewell and headed off
down the trail again. There were still more dogs, many of them pregnant.
I wondered what kind of predators lived in the woods that were above
these dogs on the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while later I saw a motorbike on the trail and knew we were back at
the bottom. Our guide boy stayed near us until we left, and I felt a
little pained leaving the boy behind even though that was his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4101897399/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunset over An Giang" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2719/4101897399_c31ebbbd2a_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 165px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The ride home was mostly vocal trance and sunset
seen from the back of a motorbike. Water was everywhere, and school
children were on their way home. I saw some of them gathered at the side
of the road waiting for a small ferry that was pulling up to the shore
getting ready to lower a walkway for them to board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at home we sat and rested and Tien nursed my bruises and bug bites
with a solve-all ointment that they always have handy. That night we
sleep soundly.&lt;/p&gt;

there wasn't enough time so we boarded and headed out with the
expectation that we'd stop in an hour or so where we could find some
food. This was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first place we stopped was a tea and fruit juice place that had
pretty much no food. There were a few things like cakes that you would
eat with your tea, so Tien and I got some cakes and ate them on the bus
as we headed up a mountain pass that was in the middle of being
reconstructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus had a DVD player and a TV at the front so people could be
entertained along the way. This was a home entertainment style DVD
player, which means it wasn't really built to handle being moved along a
bumpy dirt road winding through jungly mountains. Needless to say it
skipped a lot and they eventually turned it off. I wondered why in a
country like this with so many dirt roads a company like Mailinh who had
buses that went everywhere didn't just rip their DVDs into something
that could be played from a cheap solid state media player. I wondered
about the technological and business aspects of such a proposition,
along with my idea to put wifi at popular bus stops, since there never
is any and I'm sure people on their netbooks would use it. Perhaps the
country just isn't quite ready for that step...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I didn't get a chance to eat until 4:30pm. Hu tieu never tasted
so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the road, I saw a motorbike with logs about 6 feet long stacked
sideways on the back seat so that it took up the full lane of the road.
The sunset was beautifully colored, like tropical fruits. There were
beautiful green rice paddies illuminated by that gorgeous dusk light,
but I had a hard time photographing it and I realized it wasn't just
because we were in a moving vehicle. Vietnam is so flat that you don't
get to see much of the beauty. Trees and lines of buildings block off so
much of the natural beauty of the rice paddies and fields, and there are
so few mountains that you rarely rise above it so you can look down on
it. It's a shame, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well into the darkness of light we passed over a bridge where there were
house boats floating on still water, reflecting their lights all around
them. It was magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were coming into Saigon I saw an airplane on its descent. It was
the first airplane I had seen since we left the airport several weeks
ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a huge billboard at the side of the highway advertising HHH
Zippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Saigon, we caught a taxi to the Bui Phan but it was full except
the most expensive room, so we headed to the Ruby Star and got a cheap,
awesome room. WiFi on this floor was a problem, I was unable to get out
to the internet. Upon further investigation I discovered multiple
cascaded DD-WRT routers all using 192.168.1.0/24 on both their LAN and
WAN, and this was keeping me from getting out to the internet. After a
few guesses I was into the admin panel and was able to reconfigure them
each with their own LAN subnet so that there was no overlapping IP space
and I was soon able to actually get out onto the internet. I considered
different approaches but settled on this since I was doing all
configuration over the air. It was good enough for one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning I woke up and when I signed on I had some more problems
with the internet. My computer had switched to a different AP with the
same SSID and a different LAN subnet. This was no good. I decided to go
ahead and fix this problem once and for all by adding the WAN ports of
each router to the switch, disabling DHCP, giving all the APs the same
SSID and assigning them static addresses in the DSL modem. This allowed
roaming access throughout the hotel, the way it should be. It worked
like a charm and I felt pleased with having done something productive. I
rather missed the IT world and the puzzle of finding elegant answers to
technological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I grabbed breakfast and decided that rather than stay in Saigon
and rent a motorbike, we would return to Binh Hoa. There was potential
fun in Saigon but returning home for a few days rest was appealing, and
we'd definitely be coming through Saigon again numerous times anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard procedure for hotel checkout is playing on computers until
it is time to catch a taxi to a bus, then check out of the hotel and
head out. This is what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl on the back of a motorbike reading a book and my NV240HD
failed when I tried to take a photo of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl with a shirt that said &amp;quot;I swoop want water.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we were back with the family in Binh Hoa, sharing the
details of our trip to Da Lat. The bus trip from Saigon always wears me
out because it's not comfortable and I can't relax without my body
moving into a painful position, &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4091910467/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Scootrette" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2513/4091910467_77fee33af7_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 156px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;so after dinner and a
little bit of teaching Ngoc english from a book she had we fell fast
asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was pretty much a rest day. We did the routine shower and get
breakfast at the market. This morning though Thu brought over some
mangos and peeled them. They were delicious. I don't think I had ever
eaten mango before, except the dried kind. While we sat there eating
mango we planned to go hiking on Mt. Cam and to the floating market in
Can Tho. That evening we took a little ride around at sunset and took
some photos. That evening Mai made us sweet soup, which is a desert
style dish with sweet peas, coconut and some squiggly things made from
flour that have the consistency of those tapioca drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man who worked at …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning Da Lat was colder than it was the previous day. I
couldn't tell if it was going to clear up or pour down rain on us.
Regardless, Tien and I decided to rent a scooter for the day and go
explore the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man who worked at the hotel said we could rent a motorbike from him
for 70,000, which is roughly $8 USD. We walked across the street to
another hotel that was owned by the same people and Tien told them we
were there to rent a moto. A girl from the hotel disappeared under the
stairs into what I thought was a fountain but ended up being the way
into the car port. We sat there for 5 minutes listening to that poor
girl trying to start that motorbike and I couldn't help but wonder when
the last time it had been ridden was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually they brought round another moto for us that had very little
trouble starting. They said that the cops in Da Lat wouldn't pull me
over for not having a license, which made sense since it's one of the
most popular tourist destinations in Vietnam. Tien was happy that I
would be driving. She is a bit timid on a bike, then there is the
masculine feminine factor, and then there is romance. Of course, it
could also be that she just doesn't like driving... Anyway, I got on in
front, started it up and headed off in the wrong direction. As I was
pulling a U turn I realized that riding a scooter is different from a
motorcycle, and riding and automatic is different from a manual. Also, I
had only once ever taken a passenger on a motorcycle, and that was just
to give Lisa a ride around the block on my Honda CM450C before I sold
it. This scooter took some getting used to, but I got the hang of it in
a few hours and felt as comfortable as ever on two wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did was buy a map of the town that showed local
attractions. This proved to be both useful and useless, depending on
just where we were busy getting lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4091711945/"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Forest in Đà Lạt" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2733/4091711945_519b1f9910_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 157px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first place we went was Da Lat University.
Tien said she had seen it on TV and it was beautiful. We got gas and got
lost before finding it on top of a hill north of the lake near downtown.
We parked and walked into the campus and discovered that this was not
the place Tien had seen on TV. While I took some photographs Tien
cleared up the confusion by asking a student where the place she was
looking for might be. He showed her on the map where it was, the Teacher
Training College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the campus and got lost again before finding the other college
which was on a hill opposite the big lake in the center of town. It was
indeed more picturesque, but Tien was disappointed that it wasn't more
beautiful. There was a couple taking wedding photos by the brick
archways along side the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was mid day by then and I got the brilliant idea to have lunch on the
lake. The day was bright, and too breezy to open the awnings to shade is
from the mid day sun. The restaurant was a tourist restaurant and the
food was accordingly disappointing. Tien barely ate any of it and I was
just hungry enough to choke most of it down. Beer cost 4x what it was
other places and the &amp;quot;classic club sandwich&amp;quot; had eggs on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were at the restaurant I tried out the GPS on my iPhone and for
the first time ever in Vietnam it worked. I pulled up the geocaching app
and found that there was a geocache by Trúc Lâm. I also pulled up
lonelyplant.com and found a few choice attractions, one of which was not
on the map. We paid for our terrible food and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what must have been 30 or more minutes of driving around in
circles we found our way to the Hang Nga Crazy House. This place was not
at all what you'd expect to find in Vietnam. In fact, this was more like
Disneyland or something, but it was actually a persons house at one
time. An employee there who was very hard to understand told us that the
architect had gone to school in Russia and had come home to build this
in 1990. I couldn't understand much else of what she said, &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4083021328/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Something's up at the crazy house" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/4083021328_18b967dc81_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 183px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and I wondered how on earth people who spoke
such awful english got jobs at tour places while the man at the front
desk of our hotel spoke English almost impeccably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I wandered the house for a while and I took a bunch of photos.
It was a very dificult place to photograph though because of the odd
shapes and orientation of everything. One of the interesting things
about the house was that so much of it was made from wood. Vietnam is a
country that does not have much timber. Most of the homes are made from
brick and mortar or cement, even up in the highlands like Da Lat where
there are evergreen trees. The crazy house was almost entirely wooden on
the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found our way to some parts that were still being built; there is
always construction in Vietnam. We found a really old car in a glass
garage and I wanted to photograph it but had a poor time through the
glass even with a polarizer. I photographed some construction in a new
mountainous tower and then we left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was the geocache, but we certainly couldn't do that without
first getting lost and finding some more construction. We ended up
taking a narrow muddy road, which was precarious on a scooter, and then
merged onto what must be the smoothest street in Vietnam. It was welcome
and I enjoyed it much as it swayed through a small farming valley and up
into a forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were unable to find the geocache by Trúc Lâm, partly because I didn't
want to reach into a hole in a brick wall that was guarded by a large
spider, though I suspect the cache might be missing anyway. I didn't
care that we came all that way and didn't find the cache, I had wanted
to return to Trúc Lâm anyway since we got rained out the previous time
we were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tour group of older people had just gotten off of a gondola that stops
at the temple and we had to wade through the crowd to get to the temple.
This time it was sunny and beautiful. There were beautifully tuned wind
chimes making wonderful tones in a gentle breeze and I hoped in vain
that I would be able to buy such a beautiful chime at the gift shop out
front. I am a fan of neuroacoustic science and had learned that monks
use chimes to entrain their minds. It was evident here because you could
hear the slight detuning, the binaural beat. I started to explain the
science of it to Tien, but decided it was too complex for her vocabulary
or at least better suited for another time. This was photography time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4085593659/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Earth and Sky of Vietnam" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/4085593659_52dbc62a81_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We went down by a small lake where there
were picnic tables looking over a forest on a hill and down to another
lake with gentle forested mountains beyond it. We sat for a while and
rested, then decided to head back to town. The sun was beginning its
descend and I wanted to find somewhere to watch it set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed to a train station where there was a museum of old trains but
it was closed. We went to look for the Buddha and got severely lost and
never once even caught site of it sitting up on its hill. Giving up, we
got smoothies from a shop in the town center and went back to the lake.
The ride there was cold because the sun was almost completely set by
then and when we finally found a nice lawn it was mushy and wet. We
opted to sit on the sidewalk to see the last bit of the sunset. The
smoothies were awful and added to the coldness. We called off our
miserable sunset experience and headed back to the hotel to rest for a
while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were soon hungry since we hadn't eaten much for lunch so we decided
to go back out for food. We took our moto down to the town center and
got hu tieu, headed back to the hotel, returned our moto, decided to
head back to Saigon the next day and went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

files on my corrupt hard disk had been recovered and I knew I had that
file, a photo from last new year, back in america.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went outside and had breakfast on the terrace in front of the
hotel entrance. It was cold out there but the only place to sit was
outside. We needed to find some warm clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some small interactions with the hotel staff I thought about how
at one time I thought that you would know you knew a language well if
you got their jokes, but by this time I knew I was dead wrong. Humor
exists outside of spoken language and is sometimes the first thing you
find to communicate with somebody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked down into the courtyard and saw a man by a Motorcycle with an
easy rider logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I decided it would be a good way to see the city if we took a
tour. After breakfast a bus came by the hotel and took us off to where a
tour had just started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4088725070/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Thiền Viện Trúc Lâm" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2530/4088725070_9cff646605_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 169px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We were greeted by a tour guide who was incredibly
hard to understand. Most of what he was saying I could derive from the
context and surrounding sounds, but it was the important bits, the
things I didn't know and thus had no context for, that I was unable to
understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first place we went was a temple called Truc Lan. It was a
meditation center where people came from all over in order to study. We
didn't stay long and it began raining shortly after we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop 2 was a waterfall called Datanla. The parking lot was at the top
and we were given the option to ride a roller coaster to the bottom or
walk down. Despite the fact that last time Tien had been on a roller
coaster she went into shock I asked her anyway if she wanted to take it.
Of course she didn't and so we walked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterfall was beautiful and pretty big compared to all of the
waterfalls I've seen in recent years. The path to it went through the
forest and under the roller coaster a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the top there were shops that I had ignored on the way down.
There were women knitting hats and men carving wood into various shapes.
Tien bought a black knit beanie with a white flower on it. I went to
look for a drink and discovered that beer was only 9k compared to 15k
for a pepsi. We were just getting started on the day so I bought a
pepsi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop three was the Lat Kings house. I listened to the tour guide talk
for a while and made out much of what he said, but in the end I decided
it wasn't worth even listening to him and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I took a bunch of photos in the kings house and I really wished
I had more of my gear or a d700 to widen the perspective of my PC-E 24mm
lens. Some girl from our tour seemed to always be standing in my way
talking on the phone so I eventually skipped ahead of her. We ended up
with not enough time and were late getting back to the bus, but were
somehow the first ones there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to lunch Tien said that nothing has changed in the 11 years
since she was past in Da Lat. This was remarkable because it seems like
they're always doing construction everywhere in Vietnam. Colorado
Springs would be so jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop four was lunch. The restaurant was playing instrumental anthems
like Chariots of Fire, Crockett's Theme, and a dream rock rendition of I
need Your Love. The sauce with the chicken had a tinge of MSG, but
otherwise the food was remarkably delicious. Even the beef that came in
a tin foil packet that shouted to us that it was made another and
reheated for our lunch was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop five of our tour was a big Buddha statue that the tour guide
claimed was the biggest Buddha in Vietnam. Tien and I disagreed
silently, knowing that the Buddha on Mt. Cam was bigger. I just smiled
and nodded through the rest of what he said about the monks doing
something and some other people that seemed really important had done
something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4087853011/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Suspended Animation" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2694/4087853011_697032e284_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Stop six was called The Valley of Love. It was a
sad, wet, cold place where pale colored carnival rides sat motionless in
the mud under a crying grey sky. There was a monkey chained up in a cage
by himself going crazy and a metal lattice awning without a single
flower growing on the one vine resilient enough to withstand the gloom.
There were some miserable horses and yet more construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were leaving this last sullen stop on our tour I thought about the
catch 22 of tourist places. Here in Da Lat I didn't have a thousand eyes
staring at me everywhere I went and random people saying hello to me as
I walked down the street. The flip side was that it was not as genuine
and the prices were obviously geared towards foreign travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the hotel and crashed, tired from all the walking. It was
evening when we awoke. We got some dinner at a place that had only one
thing available, then bought and umbrella and went for a walk down by
the lake. We found a market where I bought a knit hat and an Adidas
jacket and immediately felt much warmer. I thought it was weird that I
had to buy a jacket in Vietnam, but I guess that's how it really is. We
also bought some pistachios and a bottle of wine, then moseyed on back
to the hotel for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

dead hard disk to see if it had yet another life. Luckily it did and I
put my laptop to work backing up my photos and music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tien woke up we went next door for breakfast. I was thinking a lot
about Colorado and the fact that my brother was now out of the Army. It
had been 5 years since we'd had a family Thanksgiving together since he
joined the army just before Thanksgiving. I thought about driving
straight to CO as soon as I landed in SF, or perhaps switching my flight
to land in Denver instead. It would be nice to have a family holiday
again, though I was disappointed knowing that Tien wouldn't be there...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner the previous night Tien and I had decided to go to Da Lat
instead of Nha Trang, and after breakfast we went to the travel agency
where I'd gotten my ticket for Cambodia and got the information we
needed to book a ticket to Da Lat. We went back to the hotel, reserved a
ticket on the bus and geeked out for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were a bit late checking out of the hotel and the bus service called
saying we would miss our noon bus and would have to take the next one
leaving at 1pm. We caught a taxi and headed off down Nguyen Cu Trinh to
a bus station I'd never been to before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the bus station, which was a small travel agency in
the middle of the city, it was 11:45. Tien talked to some guys on
motorbikes who told her we could still catch the 12 o'clock bus if the
took us there. She got on one and I got on the other and we sped off
through mid day traffic. The ride was quick with a lot of weaving and it
reminded me of the ride I took with My just before leaving Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motorbikes took us to a travel agency about 4 blocks from where we
had been staying. The problem was that we had booked a ticket with
Mailinh and this was not a Mailinh bus. Tien got into a little argument
with one of the drivers who demanded that we pay him 100,000 for the
ride, which was 4x what our taxi to the 1pm bus cost. When tien gets
upset she quits talking in English, even if I ask her to translate, so I
didn't know what was going on until after we were already on the bus,
otherwise I would've told that guy to get lost because it was not our
problem if he impersonated a Mailinh employee with the good intention of
getting us to our bus on time. I talked briefly with tien about not
clamming up on me so I can help her in situations like that, we accepted
a learned lesson and let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus was nice. We took off through an area of Saigon I hadn't seen
and I decided we should rent a motorbike when we come back so we can go
explore farther. The river was cool and there were new buildings being
built. It looked more like a modern civic center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the rest of Iron Orchid. It was a decent book but nothing
amazing. The ending wasn't all that climactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien began to feel motion sick because she didn't take her medicine in
time. She had some intention of staying awake on the ride and it
backfired. I felt really bad and had flashbacks to all those times I've
spent taking care of really drunk people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for food briefly just before turning off of the main highway
into the hills. The terrain was immediately different in more than just
the hills. The vegetation was more thick and tough. We continued through
winding roads for a few hours and then took a longer break. Tien and I
got drinks and skipped food thinking the bus ride would soon be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the road we headed into some mountains that reminded me of the
western approach of monarch pass in Colorado. The sun soon set and I
listened to Tom Waits while Tien slept. The evening silhouettes of hills
with hose and street light scattered off in the distant darkness were
familiar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Da Lat after 8 hours. We'd been told the ride would be 5
hours. I was hungry and tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual group of taxi drivers were waiting when we arrived. The first
man to approach me was dressed in quality jeans and a leather coat and a
helmet. He said he was with the easy riders and could take me anywhere.
I told him I was with Tien and VN conversation continued with a bus
driver who ended up being our local transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were let off at a hotel and were greeted by a happy woman. Since we
hadn't arranged a driver or a hotel and had just been scammed in saigon
I was very skeptical of what was going on and was ready to walk away if
every detail wasn't good, but it ended up that every detail was fine and
so we got a large room on the second floor with breakfast included for
half of the price we had been used to paying in Saigon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we noticed once we were finally in our room was
that Da Lat was cold. Not cool, but cold. It was also raining gently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to find some dinner and ended up at a Chinese restaurant where I
once again ordered something that I expected would have no seafood. We
weren't anywhere near the ocean, but that didn't stop the ocean gods
from frowning on my meal. I just gave the icky parts to tien and
hungrily devoured the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien was really cold on the way Home so we went hat shopping. We ended
up not finding anything and just went back to the hotel. I put my
computer to work backing up the files that were on the crashing disk,
cuddled up with tien under two heavy blankets and fell fast asleep in
the cold and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

big for his age. His older sister showed up soon afterwards and we all
ate some snacks. They were Tiens cousins and I recognized their father
from our engagement party when he came to pick them up on his scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned home, packed for our trip to Nha Trang, had lunch and caught
the bus right outside Tien's house at 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus was not the usual bus service we take, Mai Linh. It took a
different route through narrow back country roads that were more jungly
than the main roads. I recognized the route from the trip we took where
the man was joking about fighting with me. The bus seemed to be going
pretty fast but that may just be because the road was so narrow. After a
while we got to an area with muddy dirt roads with huge puddles and many
bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver turned on some pop Vietnamese music and I wondered what a
Vietnamese reggae fusion would sound like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out a book, Iron Orchard, and read. Brianna had found the book on
the street and gave it to me. It was entertaining light reading that was
good for a trip. After we stopped for a break I continued reading until
it was too dark, then I just enjoyed music and watched the lights pass
in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came upon an accident, the first serious one I've seen in Vietnam so
far. The diver of a large truck was standing by the back where a bloody
man was wallowing in pain on the ground. His motorbike was stuck between
the front and rear axels and there was an anonymous pool of liquid
coming from the darkness under the truck. I wasn't sure if he was the
only passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien looked at the scene then looked away with a shriek. She looked at
me with worried eyes and said &amp;quot;He died.&amp;quot; I thought this was an odd way
to say it. Later I came to the conclusion that her phrase told a story
from a scene that she hadn't experienced which was why it sounded
weirder than saying &amp;quot;he is dead.&amp;quot; I told her that he hadn't died. The
bus drove on and I never heard a siren or saw an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we came into Saigon it was clear that it had been raining hard. Pools
of water were standing near intersections and the sidewalk by the river
was reflecting the tail lights of motorbikes that rode down it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride seemed endless and my ass hurt from having my buttock muscle
stretched in the same position in that tiny seat for so long. We rode
through some interesting neighborhoods in Saigon including going over a
bridge that we'd seen near the new roads on our way out of town last
time. Eventually we arrived at the bus station where we caught a taxi to
a hotel I'd stayed at once before, the Bui Phan. The issue with the bed
bugs at the ruby star made us not want to go back there, plus I wanted a
bath tub.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4079878981/"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2770/4079878981_5788da3f6c_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel was conveniently right next door to Viva Coffee, so we ate
there for dinner. In Vietnam, most cafes are also restaurants. Tien's
mom called up worried and told us that the weather was bad in Nha Trang.
Her mom worries about everything, but this time she was right. The
latest AP headline read something about 32 people being dead from
flooding up towards Hanoi. There was a photo o a man motorbiking in Nha
Trang in over a foot of water that covered a whole street, and it was
still raining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning I got out of bed, picked up my laptop and found tiny
bugs crawling on it. The Bui Phan had them as well... On top of that
there was heavy construction going on outside our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I had a late breakfast and talked about cultural differences
like how multicultural different cultures are and how conservative they
are. Afterwards we went online and looked up new destinations. Traveling
as a pair was expensive and airfare was also looking more expensive
because it was nearing time for peoples fall and winter getaways. We
thought about going to Thailand and I even got in touch with a friend of
a Sara's whose family owns a resort north of Phuket. We didn't decide on
anything then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we went out for a walk to look for an external hard disk that
I'd meant to install in my laptop before leaving America. As we left the
hotel I saw a Yamaha R6 parked at the motorbike shop next door. It was
remarkable because nobody rides anything over about 110cc in Vietnam and
this was at least 600. Also, almost nobody rides real motorcycles, just
scooters which are more practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked a long way stopping at computer shops and explaining to them
what exactly I was looking for, a FireWire 2.5&amp;quot; SATA external hard drive
case. Amazingly this was t all that hard. For one, I had one with me so
I could just show them and then point out that I just needed the case, a
d two, there were plenty of computer part shops with drive cases. To my
dismay, none had FireWire ones so I had to settle for USB. the sad life
of a technology enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home I saw a shirt that said &amp;quot;Hollister California&amp;quot; and hated
fashion. What on earth is so great about Hollister? I'd never liked that
brand and I liked it even less knowing that it could be found in
Vietnam, knock-off or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel a confusing technological coincidence happened where
my old 500gb drive had mysteriously quit working while we were out
looking for a new case, which meant I didn't even need a new case. It
also meant I had lost all of my photos and music. On top of that, I
broke my only screwdriver while I was right in the middle of
investigating the problem so I had a pile of computer parts on a hotel
bed and no way to assemble them.&lt;/p&gt;

progress with other technology. A new version of Blackra1n had come out
that allowed me to upgrade my iPhone from 3.0.1 to 3.1.2 and jailbreak

only do the network unlock and not install other low level tools or app

that don't run on older versions, like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="getdropbox.com/referrals/NTIwNTUwNjA5"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;. Yelp also doesn't
run on older versions, but that's not helpful outside of

&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went for another walk to find a screwdriver and some dinner.
We tracked down a screwdriver with little problem and on the way back to
the restaurant we found a doughnut shop. Regular people do not eat
doughnuts before dinner, but Tien had never had a doughnut before so we
indulged and bought six. We walked down the street and shared three of
them on the way to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose Viva Coffee for dinner and got a table on the upstairs patio.
During this stay in Saigon we ended up eating there quite a bit no only
because most of our other outings to find decent restaurants came up
fruitless, but because it was literally 2 skinny VN doors down from our
hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had only ever sat downstairs outside, and as we made our way through
the inside and upstairs we found that the rest of the cafe was quite
different. Outside was decent patio furniture and glass tables with
trees that had colored lights hanging from the branches. There were
large reaching awnings that could be set nearby your table to give you
cover if you needed it. Inside there were rooms with bright colors under
dim light with couches set around central coffee tables. The stairs
going up were zebra print. There were large screen TVs everywhere
playing various asian and American movies. There was even a large TV
outside where we were going and at first nobody was there to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ordered dinner and I had a cocktail. The cocktails in Asia are never,
ever as good as they are in America. Most aren't even close to the same
taste, and sometimes they're flat out wrong. I had been making my way
through the cocktail list trying to find anything that was made right,
but this last night turned out to be no victorious climax as I was
served a Sex on the Beach with a cherry, a pineapple and a little straw
hat as garnish. Not even close. Fortunately it still tasted decent,
whatever it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I talked about differences again, mostly differences in
freedom. I explained again how Americans have rights that we believe
that every person should have by default, not because of some exception
or allowance in the law that says it's OK, but because it's a right that
should never be taken away. Free speech, freedom of religion, the right
to bare arms, etc.. The freedom of speech was a big point. She kept
asking me if there was anything an American could say that would get
them in trouble. I told her there really wasn't, we were free to say
whatever we like. We could bad mouth the government, the police, the
president, whoever we want that we disagree with. If you got in trouble
it was because of the circumstances surrounding what you said or it was
unjust. She thought this was amazing because, of course, she's from
Vietnam where they say you can say what you want but then they don't let
you say anything contrary to popular thought or anti-government or
revolutionary. The VN government is even giving buddhist monks a hard
time because they see even such a passive religion as competition to the
leadership of the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked a lot about gun ownership and how that is a dividing
issue in America. Tien said she's really scared of guns and she thinks
that Americans always want to shoot and kill each other because that's
what's on TV and in the movies. Obviously she doesn't think American
life is really like the movies, but to what extent it is different she
does not know. I explained both sides of the argument and then went into
detail about my perspective on the issue, that we should be allowed to
own guns in order to protect ourselves from intruders and as principle
to keep oppressors in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were chatting and eating I checked my phone and saw that my
brother had posted a Facebook update. After 4 years in the Army,
including two tours in Iraq as a combat medic, he was once again a
civilian.&lt;/p&gt;

lot of Internet in the morning. Tien got me a breakfast sandwich and
made me a banana and strawberry smoothie. What a lucky guy I am, my
fiance bringing me food at my computer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien found the information we needed about how to get me a drivers
license in Vietnam and it was incredibly simple. We headed to Long Xuyen
to get the things we needed in order to apply for it: a photograph of
20x23mm and a notarized translation of my CA driver's license. We also
cruised around to look for a DC power adapter since I forgot the one
that goes with the WRT54G that I brought from America. We found one near
a park, and after buying it I decided to go take some photos in the
park. I was looking for high places to photograph down from in order to
make the miniature perspective of the tilt/shift work, so we also headed
up to the Panda Cafe on the 6th floor of a building overlooking a main
intersection and had some drinks and took some more photos from there.
We then cruised down to a local market area, past a block full of flower
vendors that smelled a lot like San Jose smells in the spring. I told
Tien about this as we were passing through. We picked up some stuff for
Thu and headed home to spend the evening hanging out with her family. I
tried to hook up the WRT54G and found that the power adapter did not
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning we woke up and headed straight to the translation
service and then to the police station. It was a day for people to drop
things. While we were riding along I saw three people drop things off of
their motorbikes. I've also noticed that school is in session now
because the streets are full of uniformed students. The girls look
beautiful in their all-white traditional clothes, and the boys have a
classic schoolboy look in their blue pants, white shirts and red ties.
Most of them ride bicycles to school, some hitching rides with others or
on motorbikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the police station they informed us that they couldn't
give me a driver's license unless my visa was good for at least 3 more
months. This was mildly disappointing and I couldn't help but wonder if
it was a subtle attempt at extortion. I didn't care enough to find out
so we left and went to have brunch at a cafe where we often used to go
to surf the net. The food was OK and the drinks were great. We talked
about our plans to travel to Nha Trang and possibly to Thailand, what
else we would do while I was here, and about whether or not I would
return to the USA on Nov 25th, which I think is likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went and swapped the power adapter for one that we thought should
work even though it was slightly underpowered, cruised the 20 minutes
home from Long Xuyen and found that it did not work. I really didn't
think it would be so hard to find a 12v 500mA DC adapter, but surprise
surprise, Vietnam is full of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we went out in the neighborhood for a walk. We stopped at a
little cafe where some locals were watching a ridiculous television
show. We ate ice cream and mosquitoes ate me. My ice cream was one of
those triple flavors, chocolate, mint and durian. That was
interesting... it's the first time I've had durian since I knew it was
the &amp;quot;stinky fruit.&amp;quot; It definitely has a very, very odd and distinct
flavor and scent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I ate dinner on the floor with her mom and sister that evening.
I was a little melancholy and I think this made them slightly
uncomfortable, but it's not like we could talk about it. The
side-effects of not being able to speak to anybody except Tien were
beginning to get to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from nonverbal communication, another thing that was getting to me
was a pain I'd had in my ankle. Ever since I got off the plane in Tokyo
I had a pretty significant pain in my left ankle. I thought it might be
a pulled muscle or a bruise on my ankle, but the more I had thought
about it the more I thought it might be something with my ligaments. It
is a pain stretching from the middle of my shin on the inside, down to
the top part of my ankle joint, and also is affected by the arch of my
foot. Tien gave me a massage and rubbed some Ben Gay™ that her brother
in law had brought from america and that made it feel much better,
though not healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning I woke up at 7:15, which is early for me. While Tien and
I were at the market having breakfast I saw a shirt that said &amp;quot;Do u know
now much plannet u mean to me&amp;quot; and thought that was pretty funny. We
talked a bit about where we wanted to go on a trip, and afterwards we
headed to Long Xuyen to find yet another power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After visiting about 10 stores we finally tracked down a 498mA power
adapter and decided to buy it even though the man at the shop said it
was not very good quality. We took a back road to get back to the main
road which I always enjoy because I like seeing new areas. The road took
us by the river and on the way we found a crowd of people standing at
the waters edge. They weren't celebrating, but they weren't frantic
either. Tien listened to what they were saying and told me that a child
had fallen into the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man away from the crowd began to shout, but nobody paid attention. I
thought this was interesting because it seems that Vietnamese people
shout a lot. This ended up being one of those &amp;quot;never cry wolf&amp;quot;
situations because he was trying to tell them he saw something in the
water. A few more people also began shouting and soon a teenage boy ran
over and jumped in the water to look for the child there. Several people
swam along the shore, which dropped off very steeply, and were diving
under looking for the child. We stayed a while but the child was never
found...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had talked to Tien before about how children here are not taught to
swim which leads to many of them drowning, and here was a real life
example of such a tragedy. I feel stupid and ashamed that I never
thought about the fact that the children in Tien's family can't swim and
it wasn't until a few days later that one of her other family members
suggested that they be put in swimming lessons. Tien couldn't swim when
I met her, and I wondered if anybody else in her family could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got home I tried the power adapter on the wireless router and it
was too unstable and thus did not work. I decided to give up on the
whole thing, I'll just mail the power adapter once I get back to the
USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I opened a bottle of Da Lat red and had wine with dinner. It
was the first wine I'd had since leaving California and it was delicious
and familiar. It felt good to have a familiar taste that is heavily
bound to California. That night I slept deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I had planned to go to Nha Trang on Monday, a beach resort town
up towards Danang, but that morning Tien said we weren't going to go.
She had a sore on her mouth and did not want to travel far until it was
healed. I wasn't sure if this was for medical or aesthetic reasons,
though I suspected both and agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At breakfast I was trying to teach Ngoc some english words and realized
that she had a very difficult time saying words that begin with the
letter S. I asked Tien about it and she said there are very few words in
Vietnamese that begin with that letter. I thought about phonetics
exercises and games that we could do to train her mouth to say english
words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to Nha Trang we talked about going back to Mt. Cam
where we could hike up the mountain and swim in the pools of the stream
that go down from the lake on top of the mountain. We made tentative
plans to do this the next day. We also made tentative plans to teach
Ngoc and Nhi how to swim in the pool in Long Xuyen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch and I wondered about why there were no tuk tuk's in
Vietnam. Tien said that her dad and brother both used to be tuk tuk
drivers, but a while back the police said that people weren't allowed to
have them anymore. She couldn't explain the detailed reasons why, but
said that one of the reasons was because there were too many motorbikes.
I suspected that the tuk tuks were causing accidents or clogged traffic.
I found it hard to believe that anything was limited on the streets of
Vietnam, it seems like you can ride whatever you can build on the
street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon was very uneventful and empty, and the boredom of Binh
Hoa began to set in. We were going nowhere and I couldn't talk to
anybody except Tien. I was sitting idle and feeling like I was wasting
away. Tien and her sisters decided that evening that we would go to a
Catholic All Saints Day festival that was going on up the highway. I
wasn't in much of a mood to go by this point, but it was better than
sitting at home and I was up for anything at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd was huge. People were filling up the little two lane highway
and vendors came to sell flashy lights, stuffed animals, foods, all
sorts of trinkets and just about anything. There were hundreds of people
walking along the highway buying things, chatting, riding bikes, talking
on cell phones, etc.. Some were going to the graveyard to burn incense
and light candles for their loved ones. Very few were going to church to
pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt very uncomfortable in that crowd. It was like being so famous
that every single person in the crowd knew me, but I wasn't famous for
necessarily good reasons. And it was like I had a sign around my neck
that said &amp;quot;please say hello.&amp;quot; Hundreds of eyes watched me as I did
absolutely nothing interesting. People laughed and joked while watching
me. Dozens of people shouted &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; and dozens more said things that I
couldn't understand. If I had been in a better mood I think it might
have been OK, but with my frustrations from being so idle I wasn't
really in a good mood for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I just tried to take photos of stuff, but was uninspired. The
night was also very dark and it was hard to get a clear picture. We went
to the church and I took some photographs of that, lamenting that I had
no tripod. I resolved to buy one or make one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incense at the church smelled wonderful on the air and there was a
full moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I talked briefly with Tien about how I was frustrated with
the inability to communicate and the fact that we weren't finding
anything to do except be lazy at home. We decided to go ahead and go to
Nha Trang.&lt;/p&gt;

Pham Ngu Lao and had a menu in English, French and Vietnamese. We both
ordered orange juice that was fresh squeezed and not sweetened. Its
natural flavor was delicious and a nice contrast to the MSG overload
from the previous night. The food was so so, you really can't male a
tomato omelet too bad or too good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the hotel where I heard from David that he thought he
might be contagious and didn't want to expose us, so he declined a
meeting and wished us well. With that we decided to plan our return to
Binh Hoa. Tien heard that her cousin was driving to Saigon and back that
evening. At first we thought this would be great, but she changed her
mind after hearing that there were many people coming along because it
was a bus. She said that because we would be guests it would be a
cultural obligation for us to buy food for everybody, which would be
fine if it were just a few people in the car, but not with a bus full of
people. We decided to get bus tickets instead. She arranged them, we
packed our bags, checked out and headed off to the bus stop in a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxi took a route that was unfamiliar, through new, wide streets
with overpasses and bridges over a river. It was unlike any roads I'd
seen in Saigon. It was modern, something I'd expect to find in Hanoi. It
made me happy to see Saigon taking on this sort of project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were dropped off at a bus stop that I don't think we've ever been to
before. After getting our tickets we had thirty minutes left so we got
food and coffee. This may have been the dirtiest bus stop I've ever
seen, but the food and coffee were delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded our bus and it was very familiar. It's interesting to be
familiar with something when you don't understand any of the words that
are being said there. I doubt I could navigate this bus system myself.
Incidentally though, the man sitting next to me spoke English, which may
be a first for Vietnamese buses. Tien and I played wurdle until the bus
pulled out of the parking lot, which felt like it was pocked with
craters. The music went on and tien fell asleep. I wrote this, and now
the man on my right and tien on my left are Leaning their heads on my
shoulder as I peck away on my iPhone. I wonder if the camera on the
iPhone has a wide enough angle to capture this scene...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bus stopped at the usual spot to refuel and let us all move our
legs, freshen up and get food. Tien and I ordered pho and it was
absolutely delicious. This was great not only because I have a head
cold, but I have had a long string of mediocre or bad pho for I don't
know how long. Coffee and tea were also nice. We headed off again and
got to Binh Hoa after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mai and Thu met us down the street from Tien's house with motorbikes and
rode us home where the family was waiting. It was really great to see
everybody and to be home. Tien and I sat in the living room with her
mother and sisters and nieces enjoying each other's company and catching
up on the last few days. I passed out some gifts I had brought from
America, jewelry for the ladies and Jelly Bellies for the kids. Tien's
brother said that he was raising frogs. Everybody thought I should take
medicine for my cough and that I should eat food, but honestly I wasn't
hungry. Tien warmed some water for me, I took a shower and passed out.
It's amazing how traveling can wear you out sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a good night's sleep despite that I had to wake up and pee twice
during the night. At Tien's house this isn't such a simple thing. You
have to unlock this huge steel gate and slide it back, which makes a
loud screeching metal sound. The day was already warming up and I took a
cold shower that felt nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien's sister in law was out on the back porch mincing a bunch of tiny
fish. I had seen a slap-chop in CA before I left and thought it might be
a good gift. I still wonder how it would've gone over...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="align-right"&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="340" height="285" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="340" height="285" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FlZ1PRFxGpc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" align="right"&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went to the market for breakfast and had hu tieu and coffee.
Familiar food and familiar faces. Afterwards we went to see Thu's new
house being built. It is a two story brick and cement house at the edge
of the market in Binh Hoa, about a city block from Tien's parents house.
Later Tien would show me a rendering of what it will look like and it
looks pretty cool. It has an upstairs patio, which I love. Thu found one
that is similar but looks different and more to her liking, but the
builders say they can't make changes after they've started building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back through the market and went shopping for fruits and
vegetables. This is an open air market with fruits and meats laying out
in the open air. There were several fruits that I didn't recognize. Thu
bought one and cut it up for us to eat and it was very delicious. It
tasted like a grapefruit but had a much thicker rind. In fact, it did
end up being a grapefruit, but not the ones commonly seen in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed home and took a nap. I couldn't sleep much so I played Field
Runners, which I haven't played in a long time and not since they
upgraded some features. Tien gave me a massage, one of the things I
really missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we went to Long Xuyen and had dinner on a boat that cruised
up and down the river. It was fun, but the boat was really loud and
vibrated a lot. Nhi's spoon kept shaking in her bowl, I guess she had
the epicenter of the vibrations below her. I spotted a medkit and felt
like I was in a video game.&lt;/p&gt;

several blocks through the heart of the tourist area at Pham Ngu Lao and
found a lot of places that looked overpriced and inauthentic. I honestly
don't like things to be too touristy, so when I see people with color
t-shirts from the cities they have visited sitting at a fancy looking
restaurant where all the seats face the street, I shy away. We walked
down a block with big business offices and came upon a fancy cafe with
about 20 motorbikes out front and knew it must be good. This is how I am
going to gauge restaurants from now on, by how many motorbikes are out
front. If there are few it's either bad food or for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we again we went looking for meds and found nothing.
Tien said she'd call her friend who is a doctor and ask him about it. We
walked and talked and went and had smoothies. We, or rather I, talked a
lot about music and culture and how I feel like VN is prime for an
alternative culture to thrive. I feel like there is a lot of artistic
talent here that has no direction and is still tied to the traditions of
the culture, and that if there was a cultural icon who broke away from
that tradition it would have a huge effect on the direction of the next
generations. Music and visual art were my two main points of
illustration. The fact that there is no alternative music to speak of
and no graffiti in Saigon demonstrate the ties to cultural traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the hotel room and did some research online about
pharmacies and malaria. I was horrified by the stories of people on
Lariam (Mefloquine). The photos and story of the Somalia Affair were
enough for me to stay away from that med. Malarone was probably out of
the question, but I did find doxycycline and that looked very promising.
What was even more promising was learning that Vietnam doesn't even have
much of a malaria problem to begin with, and that's why it's so hard to
find anti-malarials. Apparently there is only a problem with malaria in
the high regions surrounding Laos, and one remote forested region down
south. Tien's doctor friend said this and I didn't believe it at first,
but I found malaria maps online to back it up. I wondered about the
american medical system...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I napped, and again it was too long. I've decided to call off
afternoon naps at all costs until I get my sleep schedule well in order.
Tien and I woke up just after sunset and went to have dinner. We had
pho, and we played a word game that I played with Lila's son Maks in the
car on the way to the airport where you find a word that begins with the
last letter of the previous word. Car, Road, Dream, Mellon, Nearby. This
was a fun game to play for the word association aspect of it and for the
vocabulary aspect for Tien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we wandered back to a pirate DVD and Book store we found on
my last trip, got some movies. We ate smoothies on the way back to the
hotel, then stayed up late watching Minority Report on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday Tien and I went back to coffee viva for breakfast. We sat in
the back next to a bronze statue of a topless girl reclining and arching
her back. There was supposed to be a fountain or pond, but it was dry
and smelled like fish so we moved. Over breakfast we talked about things
we could do on this trip. We considered Ha Tien Beach, Ha Long Bay since
she had never been there and Nha Trang since I had never been there.
Other countries were also considered but Laos was ruled out with the
highlands of Vietnam because of malaria. We also talked about getting me
a motorbike license back in Long Xuyen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the hotel we stopped at a motorbike rental shop and
looked at prices. It was $6 a day including helmets, which sounded
really appealing. We decided to go plan more at the hotel and come back
when we needed the bike. We picked up a pizza for an afternoon snack and
went to a park by the hotel to look for a geocache. We found where the
cache was but decided not to get it in the broad daylight because of the
muggles. Instead we went to the hotel and chilled out for a while and
ate our pizza. Tien called her old teacher Tyler about hanging out with
him but he was busy that evening. I heard back from David that he was
back from Singapore but was sick. He was resting for the rest of the day
and would let me know if he was feeling better the next day. So, with
nowhere to go we decided to nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out to walk around at dinnertime and had trouble agreeing on a
restaurant. Tien eventually pointed to a decent looking place that was
Australian themed. I got a big Saigon Red beer and some beef with rice.
It was absolutely delicious at first bite, then I was hit by the MSG
train. It wasn't a hint, it was obvious. Fortunately it was in the sauce
and I was able to eat a lot of the rice and other tasty bits without it
tasting too bad, but my mouth was still tingly afterwards. Tien's mixed
fried rice wasn't too bad, but I directed us to our now usual smoothie
spot for after MSG cleansing. The smoothie shop was conveniently right
across from the geocache, which is now the only cache in Saigon. We
found it quickly, took a trackable and went back to the hotel. We put on
Harry Potter and the half blood prince but fell asleep about thirty
minutes in, not because it was a bad movie.&lt;/p&gt;

breakfast place. It was OK, but honestly it's lost its sentimental value
with the realization that it's not that great of a restaurant. It is
very convenient though. After breakfast we went back to the hotel room
and did some online stuff and fell asleep for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we woke up, Tien's friend Trinh and her boyfriend Dat were on their
way to visit us with a couple of motorbikes. Tien and I hadn't eaten
dinner yet so when they arrived we went out to find some food. We'd
planned on getting pho, but Tien forgot about that and we ended up going
to KFC. I was amused by this, expecting their menu to have interesting
variations not available in America, but I didn't see anything that was
out of the ordinary. I quizzed Tien on what KFC meant and who that guy
was, and she had absolutely no idea. Not much of a surprise there from a
girl who didn't know McDonalds or Starbucks until she went to Malaysia,
and this is one of the things I love about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we headed out into the night traffic and instantly got
separated from Dat and Trinh. Saigon traffic can be pretty crazy and
Tien isn't used to the big city so she isn't assertive in her
motorbiking. This later lead to us putting more effort into figuring out
how to get me a motorbike license in VN. The four of us on two bikes
cruised around the city a little bit in rain amounts varying between
none and pouring, but it was warm so it wasn't all that bad. We did get
drenched though, and decided to just call it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I found it very hard to sleep, most likely from how long I'd
slept earlier that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning we woke up and tried to find a place different from the
usual place we eat breakfast, but couldn't find anything before our
hunger took priority and we went back there. On our walk we saw a minor
motorbike crash. I haven't seen many traffic accidents here, and none
have been bad since people tend to go pretty slowly, but this was the
first of two that I saw that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trinh and Dat came back to the hotel and we four headed out to a park
where Trinh liked to go a lot when she still had free time, Bình Quoí 1.
It was labeled as a tourist park, but was essentially a portrait
photographers playground. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4049362522/"&gt;&lt;img alt="TT at the falls" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4049362522_0fb6a00800_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There were barely any
tourists there, but what there were plenty of was beautiful girls
dressed to the 9's posing in front of cameras. There were also several
couples who were getting their engagement photos taken by professional
photography crews, complete with off-cam lighting, props and makeup
artists. The park was laid out with paths leading past backdrop after
backdrop. A waterfall, a cart, a cyclo, a ruined brick wall, a ruined
wall with pillars, a stone with flowers next to a pond, a bench on a
lawn, a bamboo swing, a barrel and ladle, a causeway across a pond, a
canoe in the pond, water lilies, flowers growing in vines up trees,
stone statues, so on and so forth. This made it easy for photographers
to play musical backdrops with each other, shuffling from one to the
next to put their respective couples into the various scenes. Honestly
it was pretty brilliant, and it didn't cost anything for us to get in
either. I assume they made their money off charging professional crews
and selling food and water at the eateries that were scattered
throughout the campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four of us spent an hour or so walking around and taking
photographs, then headed back towards downtown. We stopped on the way
back and I got some absolutely terrible spaghetti carbonara while Tien
enjoyed delicious Vietnamese food. I resolved not to buy anything too
culinarily distant from VN food from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home I saw a blind beggar holding a cane and a hat with his
eyes rolled back in his head kneeling at the side of the road where
hundreds of motorbikes were passing by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back near the hotel Tien and I tried to find a pharmacy for my malaria
meds but couldn't find anything. We resolved to find it later and went
back inside to take a rest. I fell asleep and didn't wake up for several
hours. My sleeping schedule still hadn't adjusted yet and it was taking
a toll on my daylight hours and my energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went briefly out with Dat and Trinh again to grab some dinner, then
they headed home while Tien and I retired to the old Ruby Star.&lt;/p&gt;

I walked
around a bit and Took pictures during sunset, then developed some photos
from a photoshoot I did for Rob's friends last weekend. I didn't bother
with the $6 Internet and before I knew it I was boarding the flight to
Saigon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese people are chatty, social people. I really wonder it is they
talk about so much. One man dropped a bag out o an overhead bin onto
another mans head across the aisle from me then apologized profusely.
There were kids running up and down the aisle of the plane, standing on
the seat playing with the lights, and a man got out of his seat right as
we were about to take off to help a woman with a screaming baby. I
couldn't help but smile at it all, what a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat next to a couple from Indiana who was on their way to volunteer at
a cafe called the masters cup which I took to be a Christian entity.
They were nice folks and I talked to the gentleman about traveling in
Asia. He mentioned that VN was limiting visas since about a month ago,
not giving out more than 30 day visas and for only a single entry. Good
thing I've still got my 6 month with over 30 days left.  He later said
that he had been in Vietnam during the war, which makes him the first
American I'd talked to about the war who had actually been in the war
and then come back. Regrettably we didn't get much time to talk about it
because I didn't find this out until the end of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We taxied forever and I soon drifted off with drams about taxiing to the
coast of Japan and then floating off across the ocean to Vietnam instead
of actually flying there. I woke up briefly for takeoff and then fell
asleep to the feelings of the g-force and the many conversations all
around, both of which were surprisingly calming. But then, it was 3am so
maybe that had something to do with it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was dreaming when I woke up. On television was a mix between
Harry potter, star wars episode 1 and star trek. I wasn't dreaming
though, apparently this is some dreadful new show. I kept anticipating a
light saber duel between Spock and Malfoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered a glass of wine and it was poured from an opaque plastic
bottle you'd expect to find juice in. Meh, it was free so I can't
complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We landed late and sat on the plane for a while before heading to the
gate.  I breezed through immigration and customs to find my lovely
fiancé Tien and her awesome sister Mai waiting for me at the front door.
We eventually found a taxi that would take Mai to the bus stop after
dropping Tien and I of at the familiar Ruby Star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streets of Saigon were mostly empty due to what must have been a
decent rain.  They were wet and shiny and looked clean.  It was great to
have my fiancé back after so long apart and so many frustrations with
I-129F. Here we were though, back in Saigon.  It was very familiar and
it seemed like only yesterday that I had been here.&lt;/p&gt;

back to San Francisco in mid August, over two months ago. In that time
I've mainly been focusing on two things: finishing an I-129f petition
for Tien and studying and practicing flash photography. Most of that
time has been spent sleeping on the floor or couch in Brianna, Lily and
Terresina's living room. I did get a sublet for a few weeks right up on
top of twin peaks, and I did stay with some other friend in that time.
Some people had suggested that I get a job and an apartment and prepare
for Tien's arrival in the US, but I just didn't want to do things that
way. Instead, once I finished Tien's petition I decided to go back to
Vietnam. So, here I am on Northwest Airlines flight 27 from San
Francisco to Tokyo where I have a quick layover before flying to Saigon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the last few months have been difficult personally because my
future has been up in the air and it's been up to me to steer the
direction of my life through wide open uncertain circumstances. My
fiance is still in Vietnam and probably can't enter the US for 7 more
months. I've been wading through the US immigration system pretty much
on my own. I have no job and no home of my own. There was the option of
starting up a photography business of my own. For a while I didn't even
have a phone, then I realized that was ridiculous and forked over $70 a
month for an iPhone plan which was extra great because of tethering. I
still don't have health insurance which led to me skipping an optional
vaccination and needing to find malaria meds in VN because I didn't find
the SF Travel Clinic until last night, and I just started planning this
trip 3 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two nights ago I took the girls out for dinner as a thank you for being
so hospitable and to have one last great time with them before heading
out. Yesterday I took care of last minute preparations. One of the
things I did was buy a pocket camera to replace the LX3 I had purchased
in Saigon last time. I lost the LX3 at Lovefest after drinking a bit too
much. I honestly have no idea where I lost it, but I was happy I didn't
lose my D300 instead. The camera I picked up was a $150 Samsung NV24HD.
The look is what first caught my eye, then its remarkable interface,
then its ability to do 60fps video and lastly its 24mm equivalent lens.
A few quick googles showed happy owners so I followed the impulse and
bought it. Following impulses is working out pretty good for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I headed down to Lila's house to crash there for the night.
Will had wrecked one of their cars so like last time I let her them
borrow mine. This works out great because they get a car and i don't
have to pay storage costs. Lila and I took Maks to his new school in
Palo Alto and then she dropped me off at SFO. My friend Blake is living
out in SF now and was flying back to CO for a week, so I met up with him
at the airport after checking in for my flight. We caught up on recent
life details and future life strategy while he waited in an incredibly
long line at the Southwest Airlines ticket counter. I left him still in
it when I had to go to the international area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the security checkpoint I was happy to see that they had gotten rid
of that lame requirement to remove your laptop. The posted signs only
said to remove oxygen mask systems, full size DVD players and game
systems, but no mention of laptops anywhere. My happiness at not having
to unpack my bag was ended with a snide comment from a TSA agent about
how I was supposed to remove my laptop for the x-Ray machine. I wished
her luck when she said she was going to take it out for me, but thought
again about how I needed that luck since I'd be the one repacking my
bag. Stupid TSA security theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought an $8 ham sandwich and a single serving bottle of wine because
I'd need to sleep on the plane. International flights may be one of the
only legitimate excuses for drinking in the morning. I ate, emailed
Tien, canceled my per-month iPhone plan and boarded the plane. We took
off ahead of schedule and are looking at a shorter than expected travel
time. Maybe I'll catch sunset in Tokyo. Hopefully it's not foggy like
last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My trip was taking the same route I took last time, SF to Tokyo to
Saigon. Last time I flew on All Nippon Airways and it was absolutely the
best airline experience I've ever had. I had tried to get another flight
with them, but after searching I found that United and NWA (Delta) were
roughly half the cost at $680 round trip. I thought this was a fantastic
deal considering I was buying two days in advance, but then I remembered
the recent flood that ravaged Hoi An and other coastal towns in that
region and it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcontinental flights are already pretty awesome with their in-flight
entertainment systems in each seat, typically more room than domestic
flights and meals and drinks are included in the ticket price. I wasn't
so sure how delta would stack up against Ana and was a little interested
in finding out. 3 hours into my flight I have some results...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entertainment system for the whole plane crashed shortly after I
started using it. The flight attendant on the intercom said it would
take 15 minutes to reboot, and it did. A sight that was familiar to me
came on the screen: tux the penguin and a bunch of black and white
textual technological jargon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few iterations the system eventually stabilized and I was
allowed the displeasure of finding innumerable bugs and limitations. The
media wasn't sortable and was not listed alphabetically. When browsing
reviews, the &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; function was 4 clicks away while the default was
&amp;quot;watch trailer&amp;quot;, which clearly assumes that people intend to watch
trailers more than skip to the next review. The media was Aldo
incorrectly linked so that clicking Forrest Gump let you watch a
Honduran movie called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1127715/"&gt;Sin
Nombre&lt;/a&gt;. There were 4 unhelpful
listings for Delta TV that ended up being popular american television
shows. The most disheartening thing was their lack of selection, there
are only a handful of movies available, nothing for me to watch. The
in-flight map showed that we had flown 8500 or so miles shortly after
takeoff. This was accompanied by a flat map, not a globe. The &amp;quot;comments&amp;quot;
link only let you take a survey and not actually leave comments, which
stiles one my personal pet peeves of interface elements that say they do
one thing and do something completely different. &amp;quot;Download now&amp;quot; is the
worst offense of this kind on the Internet. So, yeah, big fail on the
delta entertainment system unless the label it as alpha or maybe beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next test was the meal. It was actually very good, but plastic
silverware is wasteful and cheap. They did provide hand towels, coffee,
beer and wine though, so that was also nice. All in all, not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights o this trip is meeting up with an old room mate
and coworker, David Tran. He's a Vietnamese Parisian who is on a trip to
Saigon to see his family. he's actually in Singapore right now but will
be returning on Monday which gives Tien and I some time to spend in
Saigon with each other and her friend Trinh and gives me time to adjust
to the time difference, find malarone and get started on that two day
lead in before entering malaria infested areas.&lt;/p&gt;

my weekend while doped up on NyQuil and Imodium. I was finally starting
to feel better on Monday, so much so that I decided I was well enough to
drive to CO. I think I may have said goodbye to Brianna and Lily while I
was still asleep, but Terresina was still there. She was sick too, from
a night of drinking. I gave her my sympathies and a farewell and headed
out to have lunch with Rob. It was a glorious San Francisco day that
made me not want to leave, but I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 3:30pm I headed off across the Bay Bridge. It had been so long since
I'd seen it and they had done a significant amount of work on the
eastern span in the time I was gone. I'd really love to photograph it
during construction. You can't even see it when you're driving because
the barriers on the side of the bridge are so big. I was soon off into
the hills with the windows down and the music up and began enjoying my
drive quite a bit. I remembered other times I'd taken that drive,
particularly July 2nd a few years ago when I left at the same time of
day to drive all night by myself as I was doing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been traveling to new places for so long and experiencing new
things that I hadn't had much time to let things settle in properly, but
as I drove over Donner Pass this began to happen. The familiar feelings
of the mountains and the open road were great and helped me sort through
some unsettled thoughts in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught a scent in the air that reminded me of Double Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun set as I passed through Reno without stopping; the light was
beautiful. I continued thinking about the past. I began thinking about
all of the other drives I'd done between San Francisco and Colorado
Springs. The trip when Andreas hit the rabbit in the middle of the night
on the ice. The trip when Zach and I had to drive hundreds of miles
through a snow storm and had to sleep in my car at a rest stop in the
middle of Wyoming. The night I drove it alone in my convertible with the
top down. The time Fava and I drove out together and he drove back
alone. The time when Shawn, Beth, Jeff and I picked up the hitch hiking
pro mountain boarder in who had run out of gas in the middle of Utah in
the middle of the night. The time I flew to Salt Lake and Vince picked
me up and we drove back on the snow in his Legend. The time we got lost
on our detour to Las Vegas. The time we all laid down at the side of the
highway and gazed at stars. The time Olivia hit a dead deer with my car.
The trip when Gabe and I stopped frequently to take photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I've done this drive a lot. I just wish it was shorter than 1300
miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 8:45 PST I was cruising along listening to Rancid and I noticed
I was feeling really good health-wise, like I was going to be well very
soon. I felt awake and on my game for the first time since leaving
Japan. Just as I was realizing this I saw lightning strike way in the
distance ahead of me, and just after that I saw a meteorite shoot across
the sky towards the sunset. I wondered if the Perseid meteor shower was
coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning at 1:30am PST I was greeted at the Utah border with a
sign telling the death toll of I-80 for 2008 and so far in 2009. As
beautiful as it is, Utah has never seemed all that welcoming, and it's
things like this that really highlight that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 2:40 I saw another meteorite as I was looking for a gas station. Salt
Lake City has hidden its gas stations but I used my GPS to find one that
was a mile off the highway, exactly where it shouldn't be. It was
closed. I found another one though, and then found my way back to the
highway with my GPS telling me turn right, turn left, recalculating. As
I got onto the highway it said told me to continue driving for 430
miles. So I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3790684370/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wyoming Wind Farm" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2443/3790684370_bc7b6645b3_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As the sun was peaking over the horizon I came upon
a wind farm in Wyoming. I pulled over to photograph it and was delighted
to find a dirt road that led me nearby the bases of the windmills, so I
spent a long time photographing them. The sun was well above the horizon
when I left to find breakfast in a nearby town. The coffee I got with
breakfast was terrible though and I was nearly out of gas so I stopped
again and got some snacks for the road and good coffee. This little
convenience store that was tucked away outside of town was convenient
indeed as it was the first place to offer truly free wifi. I caught up
with some friends and told Nate that I'd be in his city within 3 hours,
then headed back onto the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was high in the sky and was hot and I began to get sleepy. I
thought about pulling over to take a nap since I hadn't slept at all on
the drive yet, but when I looked for a place to nap I realized that
Wyoming around I-80 has no trees as far as you can see. There was no
shade anywhere and I sure as hell wasn't going to nap in a hot car so I
just kept driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it to Colorado, followed my GPS through the somewhat familiar
streets of Fort Collins and out onto I-25. Then I noticed that I was in
Colorado and the drivers here are not to be trusted and so I got on my
guard. I looked at the highway though and thought that maybe if Colorado
would build a highway wider than 2 lanes people wouldn't seem to drive
so terribly here. Maybe they would even get along on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to Nate's house he wasn't home. I couldn't sign onto his wifi
either, and I had no phone service, so I was in a predicament. I went to
find free wifi and couldn't find it for the life of me. Everything was
protected. Even the coffee shop didn't have wifi and the surrounding
nets were all protected, including the library. I eventually drove a
long way to a coffee shop that I thought Nate would be at, but he
wasn't. In fact, nobody was because it was out of business. Like a gift
from God though, I was blessed with an open wifi signal and I used it to
check facebook where I got a message from Nate telling me he wouldn't be
home and I should go to his office on Pearl Street in downtown Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boulder was different than I expected. It was more like a normal tourist
Colorado mountain town than I had imagined. It was clean. Even the
hippies were clean, which was weird. It was rich and expensive and had
lots of nice things and people who owned nice things walking around
talking and riding bikes and shopping. It's definitely an active place.
It seems like a place for people who love the activity of city life but
don't like the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into Nate's office and met some co-workers of his. Then I went to
their meditation room, or something like that where there were pillows
and Tibetan prayer flags, and tried to take a nap but I couldn't sleep
even though I'd been awake for over 28 hours by then. Instead I did
online things, made some plans, called Fava, played with cameras. Then
we went out for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was me, Nate and his buddy Chris who had just gotten back from
traveling around Japan, Australia and New Zealand for 3 weeks. We had a
good conversation about traveling and some of the interesting
differences and awesome experiences that go with it. When the bill came
I thought we were in Malaysia, but in fact the price was in dollars and
really was that expensive. I remembered a life I used to live where I
had a job and hence had money and had no cares about spending $30 on
dinner every day. I need to not do that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nate and I cruised back to his apartment, which I'd never seen before,
and chatted a little before I realized my clock was an hour earlier than
it was and thought that we should go to bed. Nate went to bed but then I
couldn't sleep so I stayed up and wrote this. I am next going to write
Tien, then I am going to shower, and then I am going to get a good
night's sleep that will be a proper finale to 39 consecutive waking
hours.&lt;/p&gt;

symptoms on top of the ongoing digestive problems and was not a happy
camper. I slept well though, amazingly. I took a shower and played
online a little while Rob kept sleeping. I decided to look up &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/qa.htm"&gt;H1N1
symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and saw that I had most
of them, so I thought I should take this more seriously just in case. I
left Rob sleeping and went to find breakfast and medicine. I loaded up
on NyQuil, ate a banana and drank some Odwalla Mo'Beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed I was near Brianna's house so I went over there. There was an
older Asian lady in the entryway where I thought Brianna's new place
was, and I thought I might have the wrong street. I got out my phone and
it signed onto her wireless network so I knew I was in the right place.
I don't have cell phone service in the USA yet, but I used Skype on my
iPhone to call Brianna. She said she was at work and wouldn't get off
for many hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling ill and was getting tired so I parked my car on a quiet
street and went to sleep. The sun came out so I drove to Golden Gate
park and found a shady area under a tree near a public restroom and
slept for several more hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed back to Brianna's place around 5pm. Shortly after I got there
she showed up with a big smile and gave me a big hug. We went inside and
she made me some green tea and a snack while we talked about what had
happened in the two months that I was gone. Her new house was really
cool. She shares it with Lily and Terresina, but they weren't home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren called and then came over. She had just recently gotten back from
a three week trip to Australia. We caught up a bit while Brianna talked
to some boys on the phone and then showered. Terresina showed up around
9pm. She had two new tattoos and a heavy gold chain around her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Brianna's boyfriends came over with a bottle of tequila and
Terresina and Brianna made dinner for all of us. We listened to Corinne
Bailey Rae and talked and drank and and a good old time reminiscent of
dinners at 4211. The three of them went out to party in Mission and I
stayed home on the couch to sleep off my illness, the medicine in full
effect and doing its job of alleviating symptoms. In a new apartment but
on the same old couch I hoped to get a good night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

coast of Japan. I knew this because right after I saw the clouds and
ocean below I looked at the helpful map showing where we were on the
planet. I was given breakfast and the loudspeaker announced that we were
one hour out from Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eating I dozed some more, opening my eyes once in a while to see
what was outside my window. Blue ocean with tiny white caps under hazy
clouds. Nothing but a cloud. Picturesque rice paddies that were
unharvested and nobody and no boats in sight. Soon we were on the ground
and I was sleepily waiting in the security checkpoint line to get back
into the international terminal. I looked around at all the unfamiliar
people and heard them speaking in accents, some that I didn't recognize.
I heard a Japanese girl speaking in deliberate, clear english. I thought
about the world and how small my world had been while I was growing up,
and my world was larger than many. I still couldn't help wondering if
I'd done life a little wrong. I only traveled internationally once when
I was young, and I didn't travel much on my own volition, and usually
not to new places but back to old places. I didn't learn a second
language. As an english speaker it is difficult to chose which language
to master as your second, but that's really not an excuse because two
are better than one. The line was long and I had plenty of time to think
about these things. Getting through security was easy and they didn't
seem to care that I had a bunch of liquids that I didn't remove for
their inspection. So much of security is theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a little office area with wired ethernet and went to work trying
to find a way to get free internet. These guys had done their due
diligence though and I couldn't find any way around paying. This was a
problem because last time when I tried to pay I still couldn't get
online because Boingo's billing mechanism was broken. On top of that,
the Boingo software for Mac is terrible, like so many OEM apps for Mac.
They really shouldn't bother with those kinds of things and should spend
that money on something more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wandered around the airport, plodding along tiredly. It was familiar,
I had spent enough time here last time that I knew where I was and where
to go to get whatever. My flight wasn't listed on the display yet though
since it was too many hours away, so I just wandered aimlessly. I
exchanged some money and went to an electronics shop with some stuff
that isn't available in the USA, which is just a novelty to me but still
entertaining. When my flight did appear on the monitor I was 2 gates
down from where I needed to be, which would've been really convenient if
it weren't boarding in 8 hours. I got some tea, found a power outlet and
managed to successfully pay for internet access. This allowed me to kill
many hours of my layover while catching up on blogging and chatting with
some US folks who were up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sitting for too many hours I walked around the airport some more.
I noticed the stark differences between Japan and Vietnam. Before
landing in Tokyo I looked down at the rice paddies and it was
immediately evident that we were not in Vietnam, even though there were
rice paddies for as far as you could see. Japan was so clean, so quiet,
so organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was walking around looking for gifts for friends a man offered me
samples of sake, which I gladly tasted. It was delicious and I thought
about buying a bottle, but the fact that you can't even take duty free
liquids over 100ml through Japan made me wary of what other ridiculous
liquid restrictions I would encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like an eternity my plane began boarding and I watched
everybody line up and get on, then when the line was nearly nothing I
boarded and took my seat. I sat next to an older Japanese woman with a
dignified demeanor. She began writing a note and when I glanced over my
eyes picked up the word &amp;quot;unforgivable&amp;quot;. I was curious, and although I
didn't read the whole note, I did also see that she mentioned her choice
of airlines by their reputation vs simply price. She folded the note up,
put it in an envelope and gave it to one of the flight attendants. From
then on the flight attendants would stop by from time to time and talk
and talk and talk, saying &amp;quot;hai&amp;quot; over and over as this woman spoke with
calm certainty. I wondered what the note actually said...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching some of Cirque Du Soleil's Dralion, which has an awesome
juggling scene, I switched to The Soloist and proceeded to be thoroughly
unimpressed. Afterwards I managed to finally get some more sleep...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday I woke up to the ongoing sounds of a boy crying. Not wailing,
but genuinely crying. I realized it had been going on for quite a while
and wondered why his, who was seated in the next section up, didn't come
back and help him. The first thing I saw was the darkness map of the
world with our plane positioned over the pacific right on the border
between light and dark. The boy's dad eventually came back and took the
boy off to the bathroom. I closed the window shades on the two windows
next to me and went back to sleep. I couldn't stay asleep though. It was
an uncomfortable drifting in and out of sleep. Eventually we were
landing in San Francisco and as I carried my bag off into SFO I finally
woke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 5 immigration people asked me if I had all my bags as they checked
my passport. It seemed like they couldn't believe that person could have
such little luggage. That may have been the thing that set me apart from
the rest and made them select me to a full luggage search. The guy going
through my luggage also couldn't believe that I only had one bag. He,
like the passport control officer, found it hard to believe that I
didn't have a physical mailing address. The passport control officer
scratched off &amp;quot;San Francisco&amp;quot; and wrote in my parents address in
Colorado Springs. The man searching my bag asked me &amp;quot;Why did you write
down Colordo Springs if you live in San Francisco?&amp;quot; to which I replied
that I did not write down c/s. It seems so simple, move out of
apartment, quit job, live out of a backpack, yet so many people don't
understand until they stop to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara was supposed to pick me up but I wondered if she'd even be there
after my flight was late and my time was wasted while the LEO did a half
search of my tightly and intricately packed backpack. She was though and
it was great to have a friend there to whisk me away in a sleek
automobile. We headed down 101 to Mountainview to meet up with some of
the SugarCRM crew. Pretty much the whole local IT team plus Kyung showed
up and we filled a nook in the restaurant with loud friendly
conversation. Sara had to go and I was bummed that we didn't have long
enough time to catch up with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch I caught a ride back to Sugar where Lila had brought my car.
I sat and talked a while about my travels and the way that poor
countries and technology fit together, then headed up to Lila's house to
pick up some stuff I'd left there. When I got there I took a shower,
which was great because I had been out for over 36 hours without a
shower. I also tried to take a nap but couldn't sleep, so I decided to
head on up to SF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I started driving I got sleepy. Luckily I'd driven this route
a few hundred times so I could drive it comfortably while sleepy. It was
lame though, I didn't want to drive that route. I had quit my job partly
because of that drive. Between that drive and the SugarCRM HQ I felt
like my old life had been severed and I was having to pick it back up to
get to something underneath it. I just wanted to let it go and move on,
those times were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first place I went in SF was to my mailbox which hadn't been checked
in two months. All of the mail fit into the box, so it wasn't too bad.
The post office is right downtown SF, near embarcadero, and it was nice
to submerge myself back into the heart of SF, like jumping straight into
a pool to help you get used to the water quicker. The weather was kinda
bad, breezy with a little rain, but it was familiar and that was great.
The air was cool and clean, so different from anything I'd experienced
in the previous two months. I also heard seagulls for the first time in
two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as I was driving to the Sunset I witnessed the first crime I'd seen
in two months. I thought about how I hadn't felt threatened in any way
in Asia at all. The worst thing I'd encountered were animals and the
fear of getting ripped off by agreeing to an inflated price, but I
hadn't been scared of being mugged or anything while I was there. I was
sad that it took less than an hour for me to witness a crime in SF. I
love this city and honestly I don't see that much crime here, so that
was a bit of a slap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right as I was getting to Golden Gate Park I remembered the
microclimates of San Francisco, and even though it was somewhat warm
downtown it sure as hell wasn't warm by the ocean. I turned around and
drove all the way back downtown and went to my storage unit to get my
jacket and picked up some other gear while I was there, including some
camera gear I hadn't played with in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ocean was vibrant and the horizon had a crisp line as I drove to
Java Beach to get coffee and internet. I didn't stay long because Rob
told me to meet him at Noriega Pizza, so I headed down there. We talked
a little bit and it was good to see a great friend, but I had a hard
time saying a lot of stuff about my trip because I still need time to
process it. Maybe... maybe this is as good as it'll get and I should
just blab about it without thinking too hard. At any rate we had good
convo and then headed to Sea Biscuit to meet up with Rob Taylor so they
could record a podcast for (d)NOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it's just the fact that I can understand the language,
but I think that San Francisco has more doers than other countries I've
visited. Aside from Rob and Rob recording their gig in a coffee shop
with friendly and familiar folks walking in and out catching up with the
latest goings on, I've seen a lot of other people around already that
look like they're up to something fun. There is a cool energy in San
Francisco that I really really like. Some of it is the natural energy of
the city, and on top of that there is the sentimental aspect, the
familiar places with so many good memories tied to them. I was really
really happy to be back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dropped Rob Taylor off at home and headed back to Rob's place and
geeked out with laptops, linux, Star Trek and a sip of whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

power on Tuesday morning. This was a good way to get an early start
because I couldn't sleep without the fan protecting me from the
mosquitoes and cooling my body. I took a shower and headed out for
breakfast with Tien. We went to a new place that is near the internet
cafe we frequent, right next to the lake by the river in Long Xuyen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At breakfast Tien told me that she'd talked to the principle of the
school where she works and he had reminded her that she had employment
obligations that last through September. This meant that she couldn't
travel with me because she would have to resume teaching in less than a
week. We had planned on either moving to Saigon to work or more
preferably to travel a bit, probably back from Bankok down through
Malaysia where we could see all those beautiful beaches that we missed
out on last time. Now this was not going to happen because Tien would be
busy. The only reasonable option for me was to return to America on my
scheduled flight which left the next night. Even though this was an
option that I never wanted to have to pick, it felt nice to finally have
a final word on what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got home there was still no power. We decided to go to Saigon
that day and stay over night. Tien got on the phone and found us a bus
leaving at 4pm while her mom and sister fixed some food for us. Tien
told me a story about being attacked by a wild dog near her house when
she was in Jr. High. She was outside playing with her puppy and some
crazy wild dog ran up and started to attack her and her puppy, so she
picked up the puppy and ran but the dog chased them. Some local folks
saw what was happening, found some bamboo sticks and killed the wild
dog. At the end of this story we realized we didn't have enough time to
catch the 4pm, so we shot for the 5pm and began packing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went to the market to get some gifts for my family and
friends. Her family kept wanting me to take more and more stuff, not
realizing the restrictions that come with living your life out of a
backpack. I simply couldn't take a lot of what they wanted to give me
because I didn't have the room and I was already heavy laden. On top of
that, the food and liquid restrictions are so tight these days that you
can't really take either of those products. That was a shame, I was
hoping to bring back that bottle of CK Entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said my goodbyes to the family that had so graciously taken me in two
months ago, feeding me and clothing me and giving me all that they could
to make me comfortable, and had then become my own family. Saying
goodbye is hard when you don't speak their language though. How do you
convey the details of the small things you really appreciated? I did my
best and then four of us got on two scooters and headed to the Long
Xuyen bus station. I had a new energy, the energy that comes with having
a plan and putting it in motion. I was happy to be doing anything, and
more so happy to be on my way back to the USA where my family and
friends were waiting, my car was waiting, and I still had the freedom of
unemployment. I was so caught up in thinking about how great it would be
that I forgot that Tien wasn't coming with me, and when I remembered
this my heart sank a bit and something felt not right. There was nothing
I could do about it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was harvest time in her village and I saw a man on a cart pulled by
two water buffalo heading off through the waters of a tracked up rice
paddy. Many people were out moving big bags of rice from vehicle to
larger vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the bus to Saigon for the last time of my trip, I thought about
how I'd be traveling in a few days in my own car with my GPS guiding my
way, 80mph across the open highways of western America. That style of
travel is so different from the way people travel in Vietnam and I was
really grateful for the American ways that I had taken for granted. The
automobile and the highway truly were and are avenues of freedom and an
opportunity that millions of people do not have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put on the Samurai Champloo soundtrack and kept thinking about my old
familiar ways, the joys that I had given up when I left America. I was
really looking forward to getting back. I had a sore throat though and
my stomach was still a little upset. Tien was on my arm, visibly upset
but not falling apart, just looking up with those worried eyes that she
gets when something is not right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the bus station most of the ground was under about 1
foot of standing water. We once again found a taxi to take us to ye olde
Ruby Star where I got a larger room than usual, complete with a bath
tub. I got a beer, drew a bath, and relaxed. Then I got online and began
pinging a bunch of people in America and planning what I'd do when I
touched down. That night I slept deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning we woke up to the sounds of big engines, small
engines, and honking. Our larger room came complete with a double window
that was partly broken and created a hole where the sounds of Saigon
could assault our sleeping bodies. We did have to get a move on though,
so it was probably for the good. Tien got a phone call from FedEx and
while I was in the shower a courier showed up with some gear from Joby.
They asked to use a photo of mine on their page and sent out some gear
as a thank you. I had planned to use this while I was in Asia, but here
it was arriving hours from my back to America and I now had to pack this
unused gear in my bag with all of the gifts. To top it off, the shipment
came from Santa Cruz California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hurried out for breakfast at a usual spot, then came back to the
hotel where I managed to pack most of my things into my backpack. I gave
some of the left-over stuff that I wouldn't need to Tien to take back to
her house. We checked out and left our bags with the hotel
receptionists. We're in pretty good with them since we stay at that
hotel so much, and we trust them, so it was a good alternative to
carrying our bags around in the mid-day Saigon heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out to find a book store. Tien had finished the tiny book we'd
bought for her to read and were looking for something significantly more
challenging and intellectual. We asked a cyclo and scooter taxi driver
if there were any bookstores nearby, but they said not for 2 km and
offered to take us there. We declined and found store selling books
about 200 feet away. It was basically a media piracy store. We picked up
1984 and a DVD collection of Tom Cruise movies, a strange dose of
western culture for Tien to digest before she (hopefully) gets to
America in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were hot and parched by then so we went to find a coffee shop. We
found a really western style cafe with a bunch of backpackers hunched
over laptops and pay terminals. We sat at the cafe and talked for a
while, tried to figure out what to do with an empty day in Saigon. I
couldn't think of much except shopping but Tien didn't want clothes or
jewelry or shoes or any of that stuff. Instead we went to the store
where I bought my LX3 and looked at laptops. They had a decent
selection, but we weren't really happy with any of them. The Acer
netbook was nice feeling but I didn't trust its quality. Plus, I had
forgotten my wallet back at the hotel so we couldn't buy it outright
anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up grabbing our bags and having a taxi take us to a little
street where there were numerous computer shops. We looked around a bit
and although I was able to find an Asus netbook, it was more than I had
on me. We settled on a Benq Joybook. Interestingly, the one we bought
did not come with Windows but ran a derivative of Fedora 8 called
Linpus. At first I was thinking this would be bad, but on second thought
I decided it could be good. Desktop linux is pretty usable now, and it
would do pretty much everything Tien needed, so I decided to take a
slight risk and get it. Worst case we could load Windows on it later...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a cafe nearby called Jazz Cafe where we went to camp out for a
few hours, play with her new laptop and kill some time. They weren't
playing Jazz. The laptop was pretty good, a standard current netbook
with a decent build, light weight and slightly hot. The screen was nice
too. Unfortunately the OS was ... lacking. I decided that rather than
trust some one-off distro of Linux I'd load it up with Ubuntu. That is
something I'm familiar with and could help her with if there were
problems. On top of that, i just happened to have a USB key that had a
bootable Ubuntu 9.04 install on it. How geeky is that? I was worried
that I'd mess something up and not have time to fix it, but 30 minutes
later we were up and running on Ubuntu with no hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the OS was installing it finally hit me that I wasn't going to be
with Tien much longer. I explained to her that I have this third person
mode that I go into that detaches me from the emotional effects of the
things I need to do and that I wasn't just unaffected by the pending
geographical separation and time apart. I was worried she'd think I
didn't care, which I did, but I've found in my life that worrying about
inevitabilities is wasteful, even if it seems insincere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually it was time to go, so we found a taxi to take us to the
airport. There was a TV screen inside the taxi that was playing a video
of people rollerblading down the Great Wall of China. It then turned to
something about Michael Jackson and showed a video morph of what MJ
looked like from when he was young to when he died. I realized that the
King of Pop died a long time ago and all that remained was a plastic
ghost. I wonder if MJ's body has even begun decomposing yet or if it's
still as fresh as a McDonalds french fry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the airport Tien's mom and sister Thule met us. I went to check in
for my flight and when I got to the checkin area it looked like
everybody was moving to another country. Everybody in the whole line had
at least 3 suitcases stacked on carts. Some had several boxes. I
couldn't believe all of the luggage this entire group of people had, and
they weren't even together. Luckily a woman motioned me over to some
premium super-duper megastar member high speed lane that I did not
deserve to be in and I checked in for my flight in about 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien's family and I found a little cafe area to sit at while we waited
for the last hour before my flight. Tien translated a few things but
mostly we just enjoyed each other's company. Tien and I were trying
magic tricks with a Malaysia .20 piece and I made a syphon out of two
bendy straws to mix Tien's apple juice with my Sprite. I went to use the
bathroom and there were two girls in there, a mother and an attendant.
At first I wondered if I was in the right bathroom, and I was. I thought
about San Francisco and about an Erasure concert I went to, sometimes
there just is no gender separation in the bathroom. Another odd thing
about this bathroom was that one wall was a huge window that looked out
into the parking area, so all of those scooter parking folks could watch
you urinate. This was no different from watching men urinate on the side
of the road everywhere else in Vietnam, so that too wasn't really
uncomfortable. On the way I went to use the hand drier but decided
against it when I saw that people had used it for an ash tray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long it was time to leave Tien and her family. I had already said
goodbye to Tien's mom and sister a few times, so this was just another
goodbye for them, but Tien was in a trance. I thought at first she was
trying to translate some stuff in her mind, but realized that she was
just overwhelmed with emotion. I thought she fell apart when I embraced
her, but she kept herself together. It was only after she was out of
sight that I finally felt the effects of realization that I wouldn't see
her for a long time. Passport control went quickly, there was a short
wait at the gate, and soon I was sound asleep in my seat flying away
from Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

changed on us. At breakfast this morning Tien told me that she talked to
her school and had learned that she had employment obligations that
required her to stay in Vietnam and work through September. With that
finality, I've decided the best next step is for me to quit resisting
everything that is directing me to go back to America on my planned
travel date, and so I will fly back to America tomorrow night and arrive
in San Francisco before noon on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

we were walking through the airport, and it showed once we got in the
taxi. She smiled a lot and was chatting up a storm with the taxi driver.
I began to sink back into the mindset of not even needing to pay
attention to verbal communication because nobody spoke to me in a
language I knew except for words that were superfluous when paired with
body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had guessed that Malaysia would be hotter than Vietnam, but I had been
wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we drove and looked around at the familiar scenes of Vietnam Tien
said &amp;quot;my country is very poor.&amp;quot; This is something I already knew, but it
was a distinct detail now that she had something to contrast it against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the taxi driver drop us off at the usual hotel, the Ruby Star,
and we were given the same exact room we had last time, complete with
intermittently malfunctioning air conditioner and partially clogged
drain. Still it was nice to have AC at all, and at least we wouldn't get
mixed up. We rested for a bit. I caught up on some online stuff and
found that I'd lost all of my photos from a day in Cambodia, most
importantly the photos of S21. This was disappointing if only because I
wanted to use one of them to illustrate a (d)NOT article written by
Robert Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I headed out to have dinner and shop at a famous market in
Saigon. Over dinner I asked her to tell me a story and she told me her
life story, which began &amp;quot;I was born into a poor and happy family.&amp;quot; It's
true, I think I've described her family that way to people before. We
talked about the state of Vietnamese people and what Vietnam needs to
progress. We'd touched on many things related to this, such as the
communist government. It's an interesting subject to me, especially
considering the increase of western influence that is riding in on a
technological wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien made me take about 5 pills after I finished dinner. She'd gone to a
pharmacy earlier and they had given her a cocktail remedy for my ongoing
digestive problems. We then went to the market which was a one story
building with many many vendors inside of it and was much the same as
the Chinatown market in KL. We bought perfumes as we had wanted to do in
KL and then headed back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday we went to have breakfast at a restaurant we'd eaten at once
before but had since been remodeled. I had a hard time eating because I
felt really weird in a way that I could not describe. It was a feeling
I'd never experienced before but was somewhat like being hung over. I
guessed it was a lack of hydration due to the medicine I'd consumed at
dinner the night before. We went back to the hotel and I drank a ton of
water and went back to sleep. When I woke up 90 minutes later I felt
significantly better. It was time to check out, but it was not time to
catch our bus, so we sat at a coffee shop around the corner and I
downloaded Worms for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A taxi came and picked us up at the coffee shop and dropped us off at
the bus station where we sat for another 30 minutes inside a small room
where people were having loud conversations and going in and out really
quickly. I tried to sleep since I was still feeling a little ill, but
could not. Soon enough our bus arrived and we boarded in the far back
corner. The bus took off and soon after departing turned down a very
bumpy dirt road that we'd never taken before. Tien has motion sickness
problems and she didn't have any medicine to take and thus quickly
became uncomfortable. I guessed that the detour was to avoid a huge
traffic jam just outside of town, but it seemed that many people were
taking this detour and it ended up being somewhat jammed itself. Tien
asked me to put on some jazz for us to listen to. We got through the
bumpy dirt roads alright and once we were back on the paved road the
ride seemed smoother than I remember it being on other trips. It was so
smooth that we both dozed off and went to sleep for a while. When we
woke up we played Worms for a long time, and soon we were in Long Xuyen
with just a few more minutes until we were dropped off right outside her
house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With heavy backpacks, gifts in our hands and not much traffic out on
that Saturday night, we walked into the house and into warm greetings.
It was a happy time as we sat around inside exchanging gifts, showing
photos and sharing stories. Tien's family got me a pair of sandals while
I was gone, and some beer and wine which was a nice gesture since none
of them drink. I drank a beer while we all talked and had food. Then,
glorious sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning Tien and I went and had breakfast at the market. Now that
we were back home it was a good time to talk about where we were, how we
felt about traveling and our future, and level with each other about
things we'd been keeping aside for the duration of our trip. We had a
good personal talk and were both happy at the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back to the house and I opened up a package that had arrived for
me. It was a replacement Geomet'r GPS for my Nikon. It looked like it
might have the same manufacturing defect that my previous one did, but
at least I had it. I tested it and it did work, but I'm still wary of
the device and don't recommend it as a reliable geotagging solution. Not
only that, it is not flexible as it cannot be used with the LX3, whereas
a GPS data logger would work with any camera along with something like
GPS Photo Linker. I am definitely going to go that route next time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of the day being lazy and hanging out at home. I took
a long nap, longer than I'd planned. It was nearly sunset when I woke
up. Tien and I went out to cruise the village and I took a bunch of
video to show people back home what it's like. As a photographer one of
the things that frustrates me is that you honestly can't always capture
the scene with still images, even as much as you want to, so it's nice
to have some simple video to fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning we meant to get an early start but did not. We were too
late for breakfast so we headed to Long Xuyen and had lunch at our usual
internet cafe. Looking at the calendar I realized I was supposed to fly
back to the USA in just over 48 hours. We talked about our options for
the time between now and when she gets the fiancé visa approved and I
decided to not fly back to America but instead stay in Asia. I thought
that it would be more important for us to stay together during this time
than be apart for however long it's going to take. I'm still really
angry at US immigration and I think it's complete bullshit that I have
to stay out of the country if I want to be with my fiancé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained hard, then softly, and we left the coffee shop and went to a
book store. We found an english book, Sherlock Holmes - Silver Blaze,
for Tien to read to me to help her with her spoken language and
pronunciation skills. These are the two hardest things for her to have
practiced while learning english in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the book store and cruised around the city some more just trying
to find something to do and found our way to The Panda Cafe which is on
the 5th floor roof of a large electronics store and looks down on a
large round-a-bout. I had seen this place from the ground and wanted to
check it out, but it was before sunset and was probably the wrong time
to see it in its proper context. It was mostly dead. It looked cool
though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were matches in the bathroom so you could smoke; Vietnam is still
macho like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had two small expensive drinks and then left. I wanted to get a copy
of Wall-E to watch with Tien's family, so we went to a media store where
they sold knock-off music and videos. I couldn't find the movie because
all of their books were completely disorganized. Chinese movies were
stuffed in with Japanese and American, and there seemed to be no rhyme
or reason to what books the movies were placed in. I thought it was odd
that I couldn't even find a pirated copy of a movie to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home Tien pulled off to the side of the road where two people
were selling crabs from a basket. Tien asked for something and the woman
began pulling crabs out of the basket and dropping them in a plastic
bucket where the man made sure they did not jump out and crawl away like
I'd seen at another crab vendor a few blocks back. After putting about
10 crabs into the bucket they put a bag over the top, flipped it over
and tied the bag off, sealing the crabs inside. I thought that a plastic
shopping bag was not adequate protection for 10 crabs, but they double
bagged it so I couldn't complain. It ended up being OK though and we
were not maimed by the crustaceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night Tien read half of Silver Blaze to me while I dozed on the
couch, swatting mosquitoes and helping her correctly pronounce some new
words.&lt;/p&gt;

the love seat in off the patio expecting to have torrential rains
hitting soon, then I went back to sleep. When I woke up 3 hours later
everything was calm. I guess that's just how night weather is on the
west coast of Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I dream it is like a movie with actors and character
development, a climax and an ending. Some times the credits roll. This
night I had a dream in that style about a big heist, but not a bank
heist. It was something about ripping off a big corporation. I remember
less of the plot from this dream than probably any other dream I've had
like this, but I do remember the ending where about 4 of us survived an
ambush. The whole dream was narrated by Morgan Freeman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I were awake in time for breakfast this morning so we went
downstairs and had a surprisingly good meal. We went back upstairs and
relaxed for a bit and tried to figure out if we should leave, and then
after a big pillow fight we decided to pack up. We checked out and
caught a Mercedes Benz taxi back to the bus station. We got on the bus
to Seremban, the city where we had to transfer to a train that would
take us back to Kuala Lumpur. We turned on some music and zoned out and
nearly missed the station. Luckily I happened to see the walkway we'd
taken a few days earlier and recognized it in time to get off at the
exactly right stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were waiting at the train station I saw a scale and decided to
weigh myself and my backpack. I weighed 97 kg with a bunch of stuff in
my pockets, and my backpack was 16 kg. I have to say I'm pretty happy
with my backpack, especially since it holds 35 lbs of gear comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded our train and headed off. I was staring out the window
watching forests of palm trees pass by when I was struck with a craving
for Mexican food. Then I thought about Puerto Alegre in San Francisco
and how lovely their guacamole is with a margarita. There was no chance
to have anything like that here though, so I let the thought go...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked back into the Mandarin Pacific in KL and had a rest, then
headed out to find the Petronas Twin Towers. On our way down to the
Pasar Seni station I smelled cloves in the air and realized that it
wasn't the first time I had smelled them in Malaysia. I guess people
here love cloves, and I can't blame them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four stops down the line we got off at a subway stop called KLCC and
walked up a few flights of stairs. Walking up the steps from a subway
into a new city is always an exciting thing and I recalled my first time
walking up to Stockton and Market in San Francisco. I wasn't sure what
to expect here in KL, but what I did see when we walked out was a huge ƒ
building. I wasn't sure what it was but I began photographing it, and as
we strafed it I realized that it was in fact one of the two Petronas
Towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4320479369/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Petronas Twin Towers" class="align-left" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4005/4320479369_d1a8cd1574_n.jpg" style="width: 210px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Petronas Towers were enormous and awesome.
I'd never seen such at glorious building before. They were shiny and
clean and all of the spaces surrounding them were huge. Huge entryways,
huge fountain, huge driveways. Tien and I spent a long while
photographing them from near and far, and then went inside to take more
photos. Inside on the bottom levels is a four or five story mall.
Outside in the back is a large patio with an impressive fountain and an
island. We took many many photos and some videos. Tien had never been
inside of a shopping mall before and had never seen skyscrapers aside
from those in Saigon, which aren't really skyscrapers so much as tall
buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got tired from awe at the towers we were hungry, and since mall
food tends to suck I resisted the urge to let Tien try Pizza Hut for the
first time and we walked a block away and found a better, cheaper
restaurant than what would've been available at the KLCC mall. I was
beginning to feel a little ill in my digestive system, but that didn't
stop me from enjoying two beers and a delicious plate of spaghetti with
chicken. Tien got some sort of delicious chicken and rice dish and honey
lemonade. We sat and enjoyed our food as it got dark, then returned to
the Petronas Towers to take some photos of it at night. They are much
more impressive at night because of how they are lit up. Aside from the
unique Menara Kuala Lumpur Tower, the rest of the skyline wasn't even
remarkable when compared to these towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were really tired by this point so we got on the train and managed to
stay awake. Between the train station and the hotel I began thinking
about an old friend I used to work with named Ron Abitbol. Sometimes we
had to travel for work to the same places, but we didn't work together
all that long. Ron lived out of his car about half of the time, and
sometimes he'd live in his boat or in an actual dwelling of some sort.
He was a unique character, his own man. Some people thought he was
weird, and I guess he was. He did his own thing pretty much all the
time. Before I had met him he had gone to Mexico for a long time and
worked on a boat. He ended up marrying a Mexican girl and bringing her
back to America. He would wander all over. I felt like I might be a Ron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I slept unusually poor. The sickness had set in and kept me
up frequently. Even so, we ended up sleeping in late and missing
breakfast on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go to the Batu Caves, a place I'd wanted to see since I
saw Taka's photos of it. As we were getting ready a screw fell loose on
my glasses like it had back at Angkor Wat. We wandered around looking
for a micro screwdriver and found an optics shop where a girl tightened
the loose screw for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A block later we found a small temple and were invited inside. We went
in and as I was taking photos I noticed that the battery on my camera
was nearly dead. We went back to the hotel and ended up staying there
and not going to the caves at all because I felt so ill. Tien went to
find some medicine and food. I had told her to get some dried fruit. She
returned with medicine, tea and junkfood which she said was the closest
thing she could find to fried food. She did have some multigrain
crackers though and that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3757988082/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tiny Watchers" class="align-right" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2434/3757988082_c2344d4651_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 183px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We napped the afternoon away and when I woke up I was
antsy and feeling a little better, but rather than Batu Caves, we went
to Menara KL looking for a geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two train stops up we began what was a decent walk to the top of a hill.
As we got near the cache location a group of monkeys came running up. We
took photos of them and watched them play and preen. When a Menara
security guard finally left we found the cache and dropped off a travel
bug I'd found in SF. This was Tien's first geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we were at Menara we decided to go up into the tower. It was
nearly sunset and the views were gorgeous. It really helped me see the
space of the city, which was larger than the maps had led me to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many Islamic families in the tower and many of the women were
dressed head to toe in black with just eyes and hands showing. One of
them was having her photo taken, which I thought was funny since you
couldn't see almost any of her. It was like taking a portrait of
somebody wearing a gorilla suit; it could be anybody. I thought about
that custom and the more I thought about it I became slightly offended
at it. I couldn't put my reason into words but I was definitely offended
and that was strange since I don't usually get offended by people's
lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back down the 1 minute elevator ride, me feeling slightly ill on
the way, and at the bottom found a vendor playing with a really neat
crazy remote controlled car. I ended up buying it for Tien's nieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a shuttle down the hill to the street. The radio was playing a
local Malaysian radio station with pop hits in English. One thing I like
about Malaysia is that almost everybody speaks English. On top of that,
many of the Malay words are misspellings of english words. For example,
restoran, motorsikal, ekspress, monorel, and bas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a hard time staying awake on the train home because I hadn't eaten
a proper meal in a day and was extremely dehydrated due to my ongoing
gastrointestinal problems. There was a sign on the train that said
&amp;quot;Three seats are reserved for senior citizens, disabled and pregnant
ladies. Aren't we courteous?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel I noticed the the battery in my LX3 was dead so I
plugged it in with a funky 3 prong plug. Back in Vietnam I'd looked at
that plug and had nearly thrown it away since my American plugs had been
working great everywhere. In Malaysia though, all power plugs were these,
and I'd used that cable to charge my Nikon and my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was starving by this point so we went for food. I very irritably
dragged Tien Through the market and settled on chicken fried rice with
sprite, which was very satisfying. We then went to look for some gifts
for her family at the market but couldn't find anything that really
stood out and decided to get some perfume once we were back in Saigon,
since we probably couldn't bring it on the plane. We headed back to the
hotel and packed for our early departure the next day. I always take a
long time to pack so I gave Tien On the Road by Jack Kerouac and had her
read aloud to me while I packed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to sleep later than I had hoped, and 6am came too soon. We hit the
train to sentral and arrived at nearly 7, which was a bit later than
planned. Even at that time, Starbucks was not open, and we weren't going
to eat McDonalds, so we just got on the KLIA Ekspres and went to the
airport with the intention of getting breakfast there. We ended up
arriving much later than I had planned, and I was a little worried that
the lines through passport control would be as long as last time we were
there, but the whole process of getting into the international terminal
was actually very easy. This ease was the last bit of joy I experienced
in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were pretty much no breakfast places in the airport. I say this
from the perspective beyond passport control. After making one of my
innumerable uncomfortable bathroom breaks that were the result of my
ongoing illness, we went to a cafe and got coffees and a vanilla muffin,
which would've made a great breakfast if we had time to eat it. Instead,
we went down the travellators (that's what they call the moving
walkways) and got to our gate. At the gate there were unsurprisingly no
places to sit, and surprisingly another xray security checkpoint. I put
our coffee, the muffin, my phone, LX3, iPod and the remote controlled
car into a tray and passed it through the metal detectors. On the other
side I received my electronic devices soaking wet with coffee that had
spilled as it went through the machine, along with the spoken notice,
although it was not written anywhere, that I was not allowed to bring
drinks into the gate waiting area. I had run my coffee through the
machine and spilled it all over my new camera, phone and iPod for
nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank some of my drinks and left the rest there, picked up my soggy
electronic devices and my muffin, and proceeded to the waiting area for
our gate, complete with plenty of chairs and absolutely nothing else.
This was a place meant for people to wait, yet they could not bring
liquids in, and there were no restaurants or even a drinking fountain. I
sat there dehydrated from my illness and ate my muffin with no liquid to
wash it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then boarded a plane and sat there for over 30 minutes with really
irritating music that sounded like french music mixed with banghra being
played backwards, and a screaming brat in the next seat over. Neither
Tien nor I could understand a single word spoken by the man who offered
us a meal on the plane, and we ended up getting a meal that was to me
entirely inedible. At least I got a few tablespoons of Sprite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysian Airlines had bragged about being one of the few five star
airlines in the world, but judging from their airport and their air
service, I honestly wouldn't choose them if I am ever given a choice
again, and I'll avoid KLIA or at least plan ahead if I have to go there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to find some calm by listening to Chicane very loudly and
closing my eyes, but as we landed that terrible music came back on and
that brat started screaming louder, and I felt a little like I was on an
airplane straight to hell. We were in Saigon though, so at least that
was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We landed. I exchanged my ringgits and some Lao money that I still had
into dong, slew a few taxi touts, and found a good driver to take us to
the familiar District 1, Pham Ngu Lao, and the Ruby Star.&lt;/p&gt;

spot before checking out of the hotel and catching a taxi to the
airport. Tien had rarely been inside an airport before. She had never
been on a plane before. She had never left the country before. This was
the first of some big firsts for Tien and I was excited to experience
them with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We waited for our plane at the end of a remote terminal. There mens
bathroom had a girl walking around inside cleaning things while men
urinated with her right there. I thought this was interesting, and
actually I'd seen it before. She pointed me to a toilet that she'd just
finished cleaning so I went to it. What else can you do when a woman
offers you a clean toilet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At takeoff I was a little worried that Tien would go into shock like
she'd done on a roller coaster at a fun park there in Saigon on the
second day I was there. I think I forgot to write about that day, but
she basically went into shock for like 15 minutes and I had to carry her
off the roller coaster. She did ok though. I took a video of it and will
post it on youtube so you all can experience her first airplane takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meal on the plane was good, chicken beriani with vegetables on the
side, mango juice, wine, chocolates and wafer cookies. Tien always
shares her meals with me since she's a pretty small girl, and we shared
this meal too. I began to see the benefits of traveling as two, like &amp;quot;I
get more food on the airplane.&amp;quot; We listened to some music and before we
knew it we were on the ground in a foggy Kuala Lumpur. The airport was
nice, modern. There was almost nowhere to sit though, and we ended up
sitting at a train stop in order to fill out the immigration arrival
cards. Then we got forms for H1N1 and there was nowhere to fill them out
because about 100 people were needing the same exact thing. Most of us
just used the handrail of the broken moving sidewalk. Beyond health
screening was passport control where about two hundred people were
waiting. I had never seen so many people at passport control. It was
interesting people watching though. There were many girls with head
coverings, Malaysia is predominantly muslim. The police looked really
sharp, great uniforms. There was a cute little chinese american girl
doing funny things in the line next to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3741711492/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waiting at Sentral" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2583/3741711492_ca1e5c1731_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Finally out of the international zone of the
airport, we looked for transport. The airport is located some ways away
from the actual city of Kuala Lumpur and there was allegedly a train
going there. We finally found some signs pointing to an empty area at
the far end of the airport. There was literally nobody in sight and it
kinda felt like Jacob's Ladder as we proceeded down to the ticket booth
and out by the tracks. I had expected to find the train out of service
there ended up being a healthy number of people on the train when we got
there. It departed soon after we arrived, and it was a very good train.
The ride was very smooth, the speed was very quick, the seats were
comfortable. A man we were sitting with said that the train system,
Kuala Lumpur International Transit Express, was privately owned and used
to go direct to downtown, but it wasn't making money that way so it
started putting in more stops along the way and thus took longer. He
told us some more about KL, Malaysia and Singapore. He was a nice and
had a beard and a turban. He was a business man returning from a trip to
Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off the KLIA Express at KL Sentral Station, which is a huge
transit intersection. About 5 train systems come together there and
there is also a small airport. We were pretty tired from traveling so we
took a rest at Starbucks and got coffee. This was the first time Tien
had ever had Starbucks, she didn't even know what it was. I explained
how it was a huge corporate entity that pushed smaller, local coffee
shops out of businesses in cities where the government didn't intervene.
I then went on a short tirade about how huge corporate entities are bad
for locals and how they screw third world countries like Vietnam out of
their human rights like healthcare because the suits at the top don't
care a single bit about the individual who is actually doing the work
down at the bottom of the pyramid. Then we got up to catch a train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were a little confused by the whole five transit systems thing at
first, but we got some insight by following another pack packer couple
who I overheard talking about the same stop we were looking for. When we
found the ticketing area for the train we needed, all but two of the
ticketing systems were broken. I tried one but it wouldn't take actual
money so I went to the line for the other one. Then both of them broke
right in front of us as people used them. We bought tickets from a
person and then went to the turn style where all but two of them were
broken. This was the most broken train station I'd ever used. The train
was nice though, and when we left the station there as a great view of
the city. We got off one stop down in Chinatown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our train was pulling up I was checking out all of the sights. In the
distance we could see the Petronas Twin Towers that are in every
photograph of Kuala Lumpur, which we also had seen on the KLIA Express
on the way in. I saw a tall hotel called the Mandarin Pacific and
thought it would be great to stay there because we could see out over
the city, so we went and got a room there. After a short rest we went
out and got some refreshments including a bottle of cabernet. We went
back to the hotel and I enjoyed a glass of wine while taking a bath. I
bathe in every hotel that has a tub because you never know when you'll
find another one since they're so scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3739223470/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kuala Lumpur Chinatown Oldie" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2421/3739223470_585faf7fd4_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Walking outside we found a McDonalds
which was directly across the street from our hotel. I joked with Tien
about eating there but she didn't really get the joke because she had no
idea what McDonalds was. I told her that we'd eat there some day, but
not tonight. Instead we turned left to see what was that way and ended
up in the center of the Chinatown market which happened to be a block
away from our hotel. The streets were closed off and there were market
stands set up selling shoes, bags, shirts, lighters, binoculars, fruit,
dvds, scarves, belts, watches, perfume, bathing suits, etc. etc.. I
found a stiletto knife with a lighter in the handle and nearly bought
it, but I figured I couldn't take it on the plane home so I decided
against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Tien what she thought of the market and she said it was strange
that people were talking in languages that she didn't understand. I
guess we all think that the first time we are in that situation, but it
had been so long for me I had forgotten that it had happened to me when
I first went to Sunnyvale to work for the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found some good smelling perfumes and bartered the price a little
until I realized I might not have enough money to pay for the perfume
and pay for dinner, so we just left and went to have dinner. It was good
dinner, fried rice with chicken that was pretty flavorful. No doubt
fresh meat. We had fresh lychee and mango juice too. We walked around a
bit more, saw the rest of the market and some of the surrounding area
and returned to our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning we had breakfast at the hotel, which was so so. They had
strawberry jelly to put on toast so that made me happy, but cold eggs
and spring rolls aren't exactly part of the breakfast of champions. The
coffee was bleh, but hey, it was coffee so I couldn't complain. We
headed out to find a travel agency to help us plan our getaway to a
beach but amazingly we couldn't find a single one. Usually in the
backpacker districts they're everywhere, but here there were absolutely
zero to be found. Instead we looked in the Lonely Planet guide that I
had and picked out Port Dickson on the map and decided to head there if
we couldn't find a travel agent anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We packed up, got on the train and headed back to Sentral Station. On
the way up to the station Tien turned to me and commented about how she
probably looked much more confident today, which she did. I recalled
that buzz of riding public transit for the first time, experiencing all
the new things like tickets, turn-styles, route planning and waiting on
train platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Sentral we were a little confused on how to get to Port Dickson.
The map showed a train going all the way there, but people there said
that was not so. On top of that we weren't sure which train to take
since five different transit systems come together there. In the end we
figured out that we had to take a train to a city called Seremban, then
take a bus to Port Dickson, and so we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam is the official religion in Malaysia and it certainly shows. There
are girls everywhere with head coverings on, and they sell head
coverings in markets just like baseball caps and shoes. On the train
there was a girl with a head covering on and a hand bag that said
&amp;quot;bikini bottom&amp;quot;, which I thought was pretty ironic. I thought about how
Islamic girls probably wear head coverings while they swim and figured
that the Saudi Arabian Girls Swim Team would perform very poorly. There
was another older woman on the train with a head covering and hair
several inches long coming out of a mole on her neck. I don't know why,
but a lot of Asian people let the hair in their moles grow out inches
while cutting the rest of the hair on their face. It doesn't make sense
to me, and is kinda gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kill time I decided to play with Cydia on my phone, even though I
didn't have internet access. This is when I recalled how poor a lot of
OSS software is. Cydia is absolute crap without an internet connection,
and honestly is pretty poor as a package manager in general, but not
even networking software should crash in the absence of a network
connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train dropped us off a ways from the bus station and we had to walk
down a long covered pathway to get to the bus station. It took me a
while to figure out the bus station, mainly because I associated the
numbered bus parking spots with ticketing windows of the same number,
but there ended up being no correlation there. You merely had to go
stand by the bus stop labeled with the destination you wanted to go to,
get on the bus and pay for your ticket once you were onboard. Simple.
While I was figuring this out we were walking around and Tien bumped
into some Vietnamese people and was really excited to see her countrymen
while out and about in the world. It was remarkable too because even
when I was in Vietnam traveling the English speaking Vietnamese people
had said that not many Vietnamese people travel outside of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded the bus with a huge crowd and were almost the last ones on,
so I ended up having to stand at the front of the bus with one foot in
the stairwell and sit on the dashboard while Tien stood next to me. Our
bus headed off through the city and off across the countryside through
hills and winding roads on smooth paved roads. We passed a dead cow at
80kmh. We passed land that had &amp;quot;private property&amp;quot; signs, the first I'd
seen in Asia. 40 minutes later we were standing in a town we knew
nothing about, so we started walking around. 10 minutes later we
realized that we'd need help so we went to look for a map but could not
find one. We ended up talking to a taxi driver who drove us south down
the coastal road and pointed out hotels. We picked one that was tall and
was right on a beach. It was more of a resort hotel than I was looking
for, but it was nice and we wanted to be on the beach, and that we were.
Our room was large and had a patio looking straight down onto the beach
itself, which was quiet and small. Only a few people were on it and the
waves were gentle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were hungry so we went out to find some food. There was a market
across the street from our hotel so we headed that direction. At the
main street we stopped and I checked traffic to my left to make sure it
was clear, but to my right was a curve in the road that I couldn't see
around. I kept my eye on it as we walked into the first lane, but right
as we did some maniac came flying around the curve on the wrong side of
the road and full speed. Then I realized it wasn't that he was on the
wrong side of the road but that people in Malaysia drive on the left
hand side and I'd checked the road wrong. We ended up just running
across and did not get hit. This was fruitless though because some of
the restaurants were closing down and the ones that were still open only
had gross food. I wanted to find a restaurant with pictures on the menu
so I could just point and say &amp;quot;I want that.&amp;quot; I recalled a scene from
Lost in Translation where they are at the shabu shabu restaurant and
Bill Murray orders in just such a fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back to the restaurant at our hotel and looked their menu over.
There was mostly chicken and I figured that between the Muslims and the
Hindus there wouldn't be much beef or pork in this country. Tien and I
talked over dinner about traveling and mixed culture, how things are so
different in different parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we went up to our patio and drank some fruit juice and wine
and watched the sun set. After it was dark we went swimming in the
ocean. The water was as warm as a pool, the waves were gentle, and there
was nobody else around. It was really really nice, like the whole ocean
was our own pool. I taught Tien some more about swimming and she caught
on well, but got cold and worn out quickly so we went back inside after
20 minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday I woke up to thunder rolling in from the ocean from lighting
that was going on way out in the Strait of Malacca. I got up and brought
the love seat in off the patio thinking that there could be huge rains,
then went back to sleep. When I woke up it was not raining, but looked
like it had been and would be again very soon. And it did. We caught a
taxi to a bank back in town and it was raining when we got out of the
car. I withdrew some money and then realized that I had no idea where to
go or what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I began walking through the gentle rain down the side of a main
street until we saw the word &amp;quot;restoran&amp;quot; and assumed it was a restaurant.
It was, but it wasn't appetizing so we walked around some more and found
a place with decent breakfast even though it was after noon. We ate and
drank coffee, then walked some more. We found a small temple with huge
doors that had just shut when we got to them and the tiny bells all over
it were still shaking. It looked like a Hindu temple to me, but I could
be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought some drinks from a local market where a friendly man was
asking all sorts of questions like &amp;quot;Is she your wife? Where'd you get
her?&amp;quot; We left the shop and walked out towards the street and I wondered
how on earth we could get ahold of a taxi in a place that looked like it
was nowhere special, but just as I was thinking this a taxi pulled right
up in front of us and we jumped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel we rested for a while and waited for the sun to come
out a bit more, and once it began to warm up and dry out we went for a
walk down the beach. There was a park at the north end of our beach.
While we had been in the taxi I'd seen something that looked like a pier
and I wanted to check it out, but when we got there it was closed for
construction. We decided to swing on the swing set instead. Tien had
never been on a playground swing before and she loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3752562332/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Statue in the Forest" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/3752562332_1c595707b4_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We left there and found a calm beach with white
sand near the pier thing which ended up being a bridge to what was once
an island but was now a peninsula. We walked out onto it and
photographed the bridge, then continued into a forested area with weird
trees that grew up out of the ground and had branches that grew back
into the ground. Some of the branches grew up from below the ground in
an arc and then went back to the ground so that they were only an arch
of wood coming out of the sand. It was very strange and interesting and
I'd never seen anything like it before. I found a few little statues in
the forest and some other neat areas, but it wasn't exactly a beautiful
place so we didn't stay long. Instead we went back home and resumed
being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At sunset we went for a swim. There were some men on boats that were
pulling these big colorful blow-up rocket looking water toys and were
charging for rides on them. We didn't have any money since you can't
exactly bring money swimming and you wouldn't want to leave it on the
beach. I wondered how they made any money at all, even though it did
look fun. Tien and I swam for a long time and played in the waves until
after the sun had set and it began to get cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel had a sign that said that there was no wet attire allowed
beyond the edge of the lobby and especially not in the elevator since it
could cause a short circuit in the electricity. I wondered what kind of
beach resort would have such ridiculous rules. They didn't even provide
a locker room to change, so we just ignored the rule and went in while
we were still wet. The hotel had other silly rules too, like &amp;quot;no outside
food or drink&amp;quot; even though the room had a refrigerator in it and there
was no grocery store in the hotel itself. I realized that this was a
place where rules were made to not be followed.&lt;/p&gt;

in the Pham Ngu Lao area of Saigon. Our room was small and had no window
so realizing that it was time to get up was difficult from the darkness
of our bed, but an incoming phone call helped wake us up and get our
morning started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to get breakfast but ended up at a travel agency first. We got a
price for two tickets to Kuala Lumpur for the following day, then went
to go have breakfast and try to find something better. We had a
breakfast of simply bread with eggs and soy sauce with Vietnamese white
coffee, so delicious. After visiting a few other travel agencies we
decided to go with the more expensive, but more convenient time-wise
option that we first found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With travel plans covered we went to tackle the only other thing we
needed to do in Saigon, find camera gear. I was still searching for the
Loreo 3d rig and a pocket cam. We managed to find an official Canon
store, but the camera that I wanted, the Ixus 870 IS. It's a 2008 model,
but surprisingly the Canon store did have... for a whopping 9,000,000+
dong, which is more than $500. We continued our search and ended up at
some 5 story electronics store that was having a super duper awesome
mega blitz sale extravaganza palooza z0r where gold painted models were
standing outside as statues holding a sign that presumably advertised an
amazing deal and loud music with a man continuously talking about
something that must have been really really awesome could be heard from
a block away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked inside and were unable to find any 2008 model cameras, but we
did, however, find the much coveted Panasonic DMC-LX3 and my heart
rejoiced and then was immediately torn and frustrated. So much like love
it might have been just that. &amp;quot;Should I get the Canon Ixus model that
replaced the 870, or should I go with the LX3?&amp;quot; I could not even begin
to consider buying a camera that I hadn't researched online, so we went
across the street to the second floor of a bakery that smelled like
sugary pastry heaven. We got some disappointing smoothies and I did some
poor online research that led me to no conclusions. I pulled up Skype on
my iPhone and rang up some buddies in America. It was only 11pm or so
there and it was Saturday night, I figured they'd be awake and probably
happy to hear from me while they were up partying or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben didn't answer his phone, which sucked because he owns the LX3 and I
wanted to get his final word on its awesomeness. Nathan pretty much said
&amp;quot;go with the Lumix&amp;quot;, which I wasn't even really considering at this
point, and he also said &amp;quot;they're pretty much all the same once you get
above a hundred dollars or so, so you can't really go wrong&amp;quot; and that
was decent advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to the store, saw the price on the Ixus 960 and bought the
LX3. Spending that much money when I don't have a job is a tough
decision, especially after buying two next day plane tickets to another
country, but it was something I needed as a photographer and I knew I'd
be happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went back to the hotel and rested. I planned to take a nap
but ended up researching some stuff online and talking with Tien about
philanthropic technological stuff like the X-Prize and &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:Folding&amp;#64;home"&gt;Folding&amp;#64;home&lt;/a&gt;. We
also talked about Roomba, which I love. We then headed back out to get
some food while room service cleaned our room. We went to a local pizza
place and got some disappointing pizza and I got a disappointing
cocktail. We then tried to find some sandals for Tien, whose feet were
sore and in dire need of some function over fashion footwear. We were
also on the lookout for an SDHC card for the new camera, which I thought
would be incredibly easy to find but instead was incredibly difficult to
find. We found some great sandals though, perfect fit and Tien loved
them. She put them on and we walked and walked and walked and walked
until we were back at the super duper mega sale store where they only
had wimpy 2gb cards. On the way back to the hotel I found an electronics
boutique that sold me an 8gb card touted as being class six but in fact
ended up being class 4. I swear, you can't trust anything around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began to rain a long block away from our hotel and we got to the
front door just in time to be completely soaked. Luckily air
conditioning helps dry wet clothes. We rested and then went back out for
drinks. We found a nice lounge called Classica with only two other
people in it. I got a beer and Tien got a chocolate milk. They also
brought us rambutan and dragon fruit, which was nice. There was American
music playing that was half neat and half awful. All in all though it
was a nice place and made up for the mediocre lunch we'd had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retired to the hotel with anticipation of our flight to Malaysia the
next day, a new camera in hand to document our trip and new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

people in the house and didn't get up until after 9, which never
happens. Shortly after I got up the power went out, which is now pretty
normal. Tien and I decided to head into Long Xuyen to get breakfast and
return my suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast was notable because it was a pretty miserable experience. Tien
took me to a new place to try a new food. Before we even got our food I
was having respiratory problems from the fumes of passing scooters. When
breakfast came it wasn't very appetizing to loom at, and the flavor
wasn't exactly desirable to my taste buds. The thing that finally made
me a little nauseous though was one of the most disgusting dogs I've
ever seen that came wandering by. Black nipples dangled inches below the
low hanging skin of the bitches belly and sores adorned her backside as
she miserably waddled past looking for food. Tien asked me &amp;quot;is it
terrible?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yeah...&amp;quot; she just laughed, apologized and said that it was
her favorite thing to eat for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got better at our usual coffee shop near the lake where we got
lost in the Internet looking at Stereoscopic images online. I found the
Loreo 3d lens in a cap and decided I wanted to buy one if I ever found
one. We headed out to look for a camera shop and helmet shops, but
didn't really find anything good. We headed home and on the way I wished
I had a smaller camera to use for times like when I'm on the back of the
scooter, or when the d300 was too large to bring along, or when I want
to take video. I decided I really need a second camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday was yet another rainy day. Tien and I spent a usual amount of
time trying to figure out our future, this time discussing the option of
me going back to America at the end of July and having her come later
once the visa is approved. This option sucks, but may be the right way
to do it... I wasn't happy with that thought because I never wanted
another long distance relationship, and I definitely didn't want to be a
married couple who live in separate countries. The frustration with this
combined with the rain made me very tired and I slept for most of the
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening after it got dark the rain finally let up so Tien, her
sisters and I went into town just to get out for a while. We went to the
supermarket and I finally found the Da Lat wine I've been looking for,
so I bought a bottle. It was a little tart, but I enjoyed it. What can I
say? I love wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was another interesting breakfast. Tien and her mom try to make
me new things to eat, but sometimes they attempt to recreate the type of
meal I'd have in America. This morning was eggs, bread, butter, coffee,
uncooked hot dogs and pig liver pate with soy sauce. I really do
appreciate their effort to show me new things, but I had to tell Tien
that coffee and bread with eggs and soy sauce was good enough. Uncooked
hot dogs and pig liver pate have no place in an american breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, Tien's uncle from Saigon showed up in his Toyota tercel.
He was on his way through to drop somebody off and was headed back to
Saigon that day. Tien and I had been planning to go there for a day and
then fly to Malaysia, and this was the perfect chance to go, plus we
wouldn't have to ride in a bus. I was certainly ready to get back on the
road since I was setting a new record for consecutive days spent in Binh
Hoa, so we packed up and waited for him to come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we waited... And waited. We had thought he would be back in an hour,
but he wasn't. I played iPhone video games to kill time. Then I let Ngoc
play some. I taught her how to play field runners while we ate lunch and
she did better than I expected on her second try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We finally left Binh Hoa at 2pm in the cool comfort of a private car,
a rare pleasure in Vietnam. Her uncle ended up being one of those
stick shift drivers who doesn't use the friction zone so my
equilibrium was a bit off, but it was still better than the bus.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I saw a person at the side of the road with a sewing machine ready to
do alterations and repairs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien's cousins house was on the way so we stopped by for a while. It was
a nice house across a wooden footbridge from one lane sub street off the
main street. Some men were in the water building the foundation for a
wider cement bridge that would be safer for the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went inside and sat a while, eating corn on the cob and rambutan. I
went into a back room and laid down in a hammock and enjoyed how quiet
it was in this place. Quiet was something I had been longing fir since
it seems like there is noise everywhere in Binh Hoa even though it's in
the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began to rain. The rain was loud in the tin roof of the wooden
extension o the house. I really liked that place... The wood was dark
and welcoming and the vaulted ceilings made the space feel larger than
most Vietnamese buildings which have flat ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain got heavier, then the power went out, then we left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of people out on scooters despite the rain. They all
wear and share rain ponchos. I saw a man with an ATI Radeon poncho. This
was not because he worked for ATI or owned a Radeon card or probably
even a personal computer. He probably got it from someone at the factory
where it was made. Just like everything else brand name, it's not for
fashion or endorsement, it's what's available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skies outside were smooth grey and for some reason it reminded me of
Littleton. The journey was now a familiar one and I usually knew what to
expect to see ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I shared my iPod because I finally got a headphone Y splitter
that worked correctly. It was nice and I even was able to hear new
things, like how Kaskade's song Mccamon uses the sampled record noise to
make a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for dinner and I ordered beef, but somehow ended up with
seafood. This tends to happen. I most certainly never order seafood but
somehow I end up with it. Oh well...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the road I looked out into the dark night and imagined that I
was somewhere else. I used to do this as a kid on the way to Texas. Dark
roads are hardly distinguishable so you could just as well be anywhere
else in the world. I thought about the trip ahead, going to Malaysia,
just Tien and I. The car stereo was trying to drown out the music from
my iPod and I wondered what could be less sexy than Vietnamese talk
radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were dropped off at the same house I came to my first night in Saigon
and ended up at the same hotel I was staying at when I proposed to Tien.
Saigon might actually be starting to feel like home.&lt;/p&gt;

bank to withdraw some money that was a gift from my parents and my
grandmother. This took a long time. We then went to a jeweler and Tien
bought a lot of jewelry, then we exchanged the remaining dollars for
dong. This also took a long time. The jewelry was beautiful though, and
it is tradition to buy these types of jewelry with the money given by
the family of the groom. We got lunch and headed home at mid day and
took a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got up I thought I was supposed to get ready for the party, but
I wasn't. Tien had gone to get her makeup done so I just hung out and
played on my computer even as the guests began to arrive. A girl came in
and began speaking to me in very basic english, very unsure of herself.
Her name was Ngoc and she was 15. She was Tien's cousin. We talked a
little about music and other standard chit chat. I soon thought it was
time for me to get ready, but alas it was not and Tien's sister Thule
told me to take another nap. Then when I got up she told me to come out
and visit with people and gave me coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien soon showed up and said &amp;quot;get ready!&amp;quot; I explained that I had been
trying to, but her sister kept making me drink coffee and take naps. I
showered and put on my suit, the one they hadn't measured me for. It
actually looked pretty sharp and fit pretty well. I was happy with it. A
good suit makes a man happy in a unique kind of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went out into the room where the party was taking place and there were
a bunch of people I didn't know, including a table of all men. A man
came up to me and spoke to me in broken english. Ngoc said he was going
to fill the roles that my father would fill if he were here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody gave me some things to hold in a specific way, then grabbed a
bunch of the men and gave them things to hold, then we were all told to
walk outside. A photographer was directing us on where to stand and how
to stand, but of course I couldn't understand anything he was saying.
The photographer had a disfigured hand but was rockin' the camera like a
true pro. The group of us stood there in the gentle rain with
traditional engagement gifts and had our pictures taken by the
disfigured photographer. Then we went inside and had our pictures taken
in there. Then I had my picture taken alone in there, still holding that
stuff in that specific way, still not knowing exactly what I was
supposed to be doing. Somebody took the stuff away from me and
instructed me to do some traditional poses while I had my picture taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I itched my ear and noticed that there was a mosquito bite on it. I also
had one on my eyebrow. There is no part of my body that is free from
those suckers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photographer ran off to do something else and the man who was acting
as my father said &amp;quot;You stand there alone for ten minutes until your
bride comes.&amp;quot; So I stood there by myself for about ten minutes while a
bunch of other people had their pictures taken, and things were opened
and candles were lit and more pictures were taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man acting as my father came up and asked me something about
religion, and I wasn't sure what he was asking, but when I asked a
clarifying question he just said a statement and didn't respond as if he
still needed an answer to his original question. I realized that this is
a common phenomenon with miscommunication. Somebody will ask you a
question, but when that question isn't understood they simply turn the
question into a statement about their stance on what the answer had to
do with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien appeared in the door and had her picture taken. Then she came out
where I could see her. She was wearing traditional clothes and looked
amazing. I think she looks great in red, and that's what she was
wearing. One by one I took the jewelry that we'd bought earlier in the
day and put it on her, posing for a photograph with each piece. We were
then instructed to do this and that, and I was really confused as to
what to do because there were several people talking loudly to each
other in my immediate vicinity. Tien tried to explain something to me,
but a man was shouting in my other ear so I decided it was probably best
to just go along with whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about how I was a lot like a dog living with Tien's family.
Her sister tells me to go sleep, then feeds me. Everybody talks in a
language I don't understand except for a few words. They feed me, laugh
with me, I entertain them with tricks. Then when a group of people show
up I get confused as to who to listen to and do my best to behave the
way I think I should, but I honestly have no idea how that should be
other than behaving, smiling and minding my manners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I were instructed to walk slowly outside to have our pictures
taken. Traffic was flowing on the road near the front of her house where
there were flowers adorning the entryway. Trucks and motorbikes passed
by and honked, and for a moment I thought they were honking
congratulations but I then remembered that they always honk like this
and were simply driving by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way out to a van, piled in and drove off through the rain to
a restaurant in Long Xuyen. As we were driving I again appreciated how
nice my suit was. I felt like James Bond looking so sharp in a nice suit
in a third world country passing by a river with boats and machinery
around it. I tried to think of a spy plot but couldn't come up with
anything specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed over one half of a bridge where the other half was still
being built. One of the cranes had fallen into the river because the
ground below it slid out from underneath it. Thankfully it landed on the
river bank instead of on the one good part of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3758247106/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Feed me cake" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2446/3758247106_f37358aafa_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 229px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I thought about the paradox between the actions of
reality and the ceremony that celebrates an occasion. We were
celebrating this engagement between Tien and I, an occasion that is
romantic and amorous, but I felt like I was participating in a play
where I was merely playing a part but wasn't actually supposed to feel
anything. Like I was supposed to appear in love, but couldn't actually
act on the feelings of actually being in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the restaurant and had more photos taken at the entryway.
When we got to the dining room floor everybody was already seated,
eating and drinking. Tien and I had more photos taken in the surrounding
area. We walked down the aisle between the tables, having our photo
taken, and got onto the stage where we had our photo taken. I was
finding it very hard to concentrate because a light nearby was trying
its hardest to set something on fire, and I could see and smell the
smoke. This was going on right by a big cake that we were supposed to
cut, and we cut it while we had our photos taken and the light bulb kept
trying to set things on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got off the stage there was this really loud, really awful music
playing. I looked up towards the DJ booth and saw a karaoke display
cuing words, but nobody was singing. We had instrumental karaoke music.
Soon the man who had acted in place of my father got on stage and said
some things, and then began to sing. Tien and I were finally allowed to
eat. They brought me Saigon Red Beer, and gave us food and people sang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3725060671/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Drinkin Bia" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3517/3725060671_a65af12df0_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was having a really good time. The singing was fun, the
company was great, the occasion was great, the beer was good, the food
was good. I asked Tien what it was we were eating but she didn't know
what it was called. She just said that it was part of a pig, and after
looking again at it I guessed it was pig stomach. It was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table of men who had been at Tien's house was now sitting at one of
the tables at the restaurant. They were a bunch of badasses. They were
smoking and cheering and saying loud things while pointing like they
were totally going to go do something awesome as one big gang. One of
them got up on stage with Tien's brother and sang karaoke with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman next to me was trying to get me to eat my rice quicker, so I
obliged, but when I did I got the hiccups. Then I thought I was going to
look like a drunk with the hiccups so I drank beer to wash the rice down
and that probably made me look more like a drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien sang some songs, and after one she stayed on stage and danced a
little and then I got on stage and danced with her and we had our photos
taken. Then the end of the song erupted into another big photo session
with everybody in the restaurant coming up to take turns being
photographed with Tien and I underneath a green light. This went on for
some time, and all the sudden the party was over. The music was off,
people were going back to the van and it was dark out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hadn't even eaten a single piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the cake, got in the van with a bunch of other people and drove
back to Tien's house. When we got there Tien's mom started cutting the
cake up and putting it in bags for people to take home. There were
hardly any people left though, but some of us got spoons and started
eating the cake right off the platter. It was delicious. There were
butterflies and flowers made of white chocolate and mint chocolate. We
ate until we didn't want anymore and there was still half the cake left
over. Then everybody left and I laid in the hammock for a while and
somehow ended up asleep in my bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a great party, even if I didn't understand a word of what
was said during the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

much to do outside when it's rainy, and it's difficult to get places on
a scooter while it's raining. I was on my computer fiddling around when
Tien came in looking a little sad and told me that her mother and sister
didn't approve of us getting a tourist visa to get into the USA quickly
because they said it was impossible, and that if we wanted to do it that
way we didn't need to celebrate the engagement party. I didn't
understand why on earth those two things had anything to do with each
other. We talked a long time about it and I could barely make sense of
it. I was incredibly frustrated and started questioning everything,
which is typical &amp;quot;shit doesn't make sense&amp;quot; behavior for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went out to a nearby cafe. The place was wide open, as most
places in this area are. It was made up of a grid of posts holding up a
thatched roof and between the posts were hammocks. In the centers of the
squares created by the hammocks were tables and chairs. We sat at one
table and Tien ordered a milk that she ended up never touching. We again
tried to make sense of things, tried to figure out a plan to get into
America at the end of the month. We were still set on getting the
tourist visa because it only made sense, so we decided to somehow
continue down that path. With that resolve, we rode off to another
restaurant and got food and beer. Just as we sat down it began to rain
heavily with lots of wind, and for the first time in Vietnam I was cold
and wished I had a hoodie. Tien hadn't dressed well for the weather and
was freezing. When the wind and rain subsided a little bit we got on the
scooter and rode home through the rain, then cuddled up under a blanket
to get warm, eventually migrating to the bed and sleeping for the rest
of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday I woke up with the intent to unravel every last detail I could
find about the tourist visa and whether or not it was a good idea. Just
as we were filling out the form I noticed one detail and decided to do
some googling before submitting the application. About 30 minutes later
I had relented to doing things a different way, with the fiance visa. It
was not because going to the USA on a tourist visa was impossible, but
because the short time frame we were aiming for could create some large
legal hurdles in the future, potentially creating immense problems for
us that could last years. I decided it was better to wait a few months
and get things done easily from the beginning than spend years trying to
sort things out. I decided this because I am already exhausted from all
the bullshit associated with US immigration. It's unbelievable how
difficult it is to get things done the right way, and it is very easy to
see why so many people take shortcuts or simply enter the country
illegally. For many people I would wager to say there is hardly an
alternative to illegal entry. When I looked through forums online I
found many many people who were also incredibly frustrated at how
difficult it is to legally immigrate their fiance or spouse. This seems
to be par for the course with the US gov though. Just look at the recent
stimulus bills that essentially gave the irresponsible people a free
ride out of responsibility and shared that burden with those of us who
had been responsible all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, every time I ran into another detail with the word
&amp;quot;months&amp;quot; in it I thought of Anthony Hopkins after he had his stroke in
The Legends of the Fall, talking to his son Brad Pitt. &amp;quot;Screw the
government.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found a website,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.visajourney.com"&gt;www.visajourney.com&lt;/a&gt;, that tracks visa
processing times and although the estimated time for a fiancé visa is 6
months, apparently it only takes 75 days on average in Ho Chi Minh City,
which was much more reasonable. So, after conceding defeat, Tien and I
headed into town to take care of some things for our engagement party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw men playing soccer barefoot in a parking lot off the side of the
road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were riding I heard somebody call out, and when I turned to
look it was the fight guy from the bus. I was so amazed to see somebody
I actually knew while I was out and about that before I knew it I'd
smacked him on the arm even as we were riding and said &amp;quot;look at this
guy!&amp;quot; as if he could speak english. Tien laughed a lot and then some
stuff was said in Vietnamese and soon I waved goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening Tien and I went to a more upscale lounge style restaurant,
probably the most swank place I've been in Vietnam, and got some
smoothies. It amazes me that so many of these places don't even have
alcoholic drinks on the menu. A lounge like this place in SF would be
charging $8+ for cocktails and probably wouldn't even have a blender to
make a smoothie with if you wanted one. We watched some American movie
on TV and waited for the standard evening rain to stop, but it didn't
stop, so again we just rode home in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

bad news from the people in my village...&amp;quot; She went on to tell me that
the father of her best friend Trinh, whose family lives across the
street, was on his way back from taking his parents to the airport when
he had a heart attack. Trinh and her boyfriend rushed him to the
hospital where they diagnosed him as immediately needing an operation.
It was an expensive operation and Trinh did not have the money, but they
would not do the operation until they had the money. Trinh and her
boyfriend rushed off to the bank to get the money that was needed, but
by the time they returned to the hospital her father was dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien said he was a good man. Good to his family, good to the people in
the village. I had met his wife, she is a wonderful woman. He had
planned to take her to a tailor to get new clothes made so they could
attend the engagement party for Tien and I. This family was close to
Tien's family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trinh and her boyfriend were on their way back from the hospital with
her father's body. When Tien and I headed in to Long Xuyen to take care
of some engagement stuff they had just arrived at the house and were
preparing a memorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the day Tien and I went over to their house. Trinh's father was
laying on the bed under a blanket, a flower in his mouth, his wife at
his side fanning the flies off of his body. A table was at the end of
the bed with a photo and a little shrine with many sticks of incense and
cigarettes burning in his honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never met Trinh, and this was hardly a good time for
introductions, so I ended up not even talking to her. Her boyfriend was
nice though, he was taking care of most of the folks who were coming in
to pay their respects. Tien spent a lot of time with Trinh while I sat
at the side of the room and took in the gravity of the situation. I
partly wanted to photograph the scene, but didn't want to actually go
through with doing it. The photographs would've been amazing though
because of the genuine sorrow. It was bittersweet. Clearly these people
loved this man, but now he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave my regards to Trinh's mother and then Tien and I went back to her
house. We talked about how unfair it is that sometimes money rules who
gets to live and who has to die. It's interesting that this sort of
thing happens in a communist country. We talked about the health of
people in Vietnam and how they handle medical problems. She says that
people do not go to the doctor, they just take medicine to alleviate
their symptoms, and if the symptoms don't go away then they go to the
doctor. She said that they do a bunch of things that probably don't help
serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is really different over here in Vietnam. So much is the same,
but so much is different...&lt;/p&gt;

40 minutes late is par for the course in Vietnamese transit. As we were
getting on a man in a brown shirt shook my hand and tried to talk to me
in Vietnamese. I just passed him and found a seat, stuffed my bag under
it, verified that there wasn't a single position I could sit in that was
comfortable and turned my iPod on. We cruised around all sorts of weird
city streets picking up passengers from dead end dirt roads, big
industrial complexes, the side of empty city streets and so on. A few
employees were directing people where to sit when they came on, and sent
most of them to the back of the bus. The front seats had been designated
as reserved by placing plastic kiddy chairs on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 minutes into the journey I smelled smoke in the air, but it
wasn't the kind of smoke on the breeze that blows in from outside. I
looked up and sure enough there was a man smoking in front of the bus.
It was the man in the brown shirt. Then I realized the two gentlemen
directly in front of us were also smoking. I wondered when they would be
told they weren't allowed to smoke, but when an employee stood up and
lit a cigarette my hopes of clean air disappeared in the growing cloud
of smoke. Pretty soon there were about 10 people on the bus smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours into the ride the man in the brown shirt came walking down
the aisle and said something to me. Tien translated it. &amp;quot;He wants to
fight you.&amp;quot; He was just joking though, and in fact ended up being an
employee of the bus service. He began directing people around here and
there, and kept coming back to say things to me in Vietnamese. He was
obsessed with fighting me. He was also obsessed with the hair on my arms
and legs. He kept feeling the hair on my arm and on my legs, saying
things about fighting me, and about how he had a beautiful daughter he
wanted to introduce me to, and about how he wished he had a son so he
could show him all these wonderful things. At one point I could've sworn
I heard him say &amp;quot;gay man&amp;quot; as he looked at me, and after that I was
convinced that he was gay. This joking and touching went on throughout
the whole bus trip. He was good at his job though. I've never seen
vendor ladies get off a bus quicker than when he shouted at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting character was a man who got on the bus at one of the
stops. He was wearing a pale blue suit and had long wide fingernails. He
had medium length black hair and was carrying a black bag. He set the
bag down by my outstretched left foot, reached in and pulled out a
microphone, turned something on with a spark and then began trying to
sell people little sea horses over his PA system. He also tried to sell
them some weird herb medicine and something else in a little cylinder.
He got off at the next stop and I was glad he wasn't shouting into my
sandal anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 10am we finally got home. 8 hours and the second worst night of
sleep on my trip, successive to the worst night. I greeted Tien's family
and spent a little bit of time with them, but was immensely thankful
when they suggest I take a shower and get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up and caught up on some internet stuff while it was raining
outside, then Tien and I headed back to Long Xuyen to pick up the
engagement photos that we'd taken before I went to Cambodia. They were
good quality, though a bit silly. It's funny, but some of them are
actually very good. I dislike the way I look in them and wish I could've
gotten a tan and a haircut before the shoot, but everybody here swears
up and down that I look handsome and I that's what counts since the
photos are more for the family than myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got home I went straight back to the internet to conspire on how
to circumvent the mountainous bullshit related to Tien's visa. I was up
late working on that, and when I finally got to bed I slept wonderfully.
The first night of great, uninterrupted sleep since I had left Laos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up early the next day and began playing games with Ngoc. I was
fascinated with what was required for an adult english speaker to play a
video game with a Vietnamese child. Unfortunately I didn't have many
games on my iPhone, but decided to buy a few and see how well she did
with them. Crayon Physics was a little steep of a learning curve for a 4
year old with no instruction. Before I could get any more games the
power went out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning was still early so Tien and I went down to an internet cafe
and I talked with Lila about ways to handle the visa stuff. She gave me
some great ideas that I had considered, but not from the angle she was
attacking it and I decided that would be my best bet. I was happy with
the information I'd found and the ideas I now had on how to possibly get
Tien's visa handled in a timely manner. It involved a little extra help
from other people, but sounded promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home I got this awesome idea on how to circumvent the whole
visa thing entirely, bought a SIM card and talked it over with Rob, then
came to the conclusion that it was not awesome at all and there was no
way it would work. Oh well, gotta keep the creativity flowing, even when
it takes you to dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power was still out when we got home. It came on briefly, then went
off again. Tien and I went to a nearby internet cafe to do a few more
bits of research, and soon afterwards the power there went out as well,
but I had gotten most of the information I needed. When we got back home
the power came on and we went back to work on the visa stuff. We had
hoped to get the help of her brother in law for part of the visa stuff,
but he was unwilling to help because he said it wouldn't work. This was
frustrating to me because it seemed like nobody wanted to even try
except me. I had this dream about marrying tien, traveling with her and
taking her back to America. Only one of those had even remotely come
true, that being traveling to Vung Tau which is a drop in the bucket
compared to what I had hoped for, and the other two aspects were
mountainous hurdles. I was really frustrated so Tien and I went for a
ride on the scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a dog laying in a hammock, chewing on the netting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up at a spot that I like in a nearby field where they are
preparing to do construction. We watched a beautiful sunset as we talked
about the hardships we are facing in making our dreams come true, but
resolved to keep on trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went out to do some engagement party preparation. I got
fitted for a suit without them even picking up a measuring tape. We got
some coffee and I sent a quick e-mail from my phone to Dan and Cass
asking them for help with the visa stuff. By the time we got home they
were waking up back in America, had read my e-mail and had agreed to
help however they could. The feeling of receiving their support was
glorious and I was reminded of how awesome it is to have great friends
in times of need. It's awesome to have great friends at any time, but
when they are there for you when you are in a tight spot it is a
glorious feeling. My spirits were revived and later that evening I went
to work discussing the details with Cass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner time I had a beer, which is uncommon in Tien's house, and
enjoyed watching Ngoc and Tien's sisters play with Labryth and GloBall.
These were much more fun for Ngoc, though it may have been because Thule
had instructed her on how to play, I couldn't tell. In the middle of it
all, a tiny lizard jumped onto me and I ended up chasing it around
trying to catch it. When I finally did catch it I found that it was too
small to do the belly sleep trick, so I let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a great day and the sleep that Tien got as she drifted off
beside me was a great way to finish it off. Saturday morning I woke up
to Tien climbing back into bed. &amp;quot;I have some bad news from the people in
my village...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

a friend of hers who she knew online and he invited us to stay at his
place in Binh Duong, which was on the way to Saigon, so we decided to
go. Unfortunately when we found the bus station there was no bus
directly to Binh Duong so we had to take a bus to Saigon, then go back
on another bus. This was OK though because Tien and I wanted to go down
to the consulate and ask them some questions about the visa stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got on a bus and headed for Saigon. Like many buses, this one had a
TV playing random entertainment. This bus was playing a DVD with some
apparently famous Vietnamese people singing. It was called Paris by
Night 25th Anniversary. Mostly it was people singing, but there were
interviews with the set crew and some other entertaining scenes. At one
point a girl had a dream that she woke up and found a genie lamp, but
when she rubbed the lamp Osama Bin Laden came out instead of a genie.
I'm not sure about all that happened since it was in Vietnamese, but by
her second wish Bin Laden laughed maniacally and shot off his AK47 in
the air and disappeared in a cloud of smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that scene the DVD began skipping so the driver turned it
off and put on music set composed of 8 songs on repeat. One of these
songs was Akon's &amp;quot;I Wanna Fuck You&amp;quot; and I couldn't help thinking of the
European commercial about english lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to Saigon we caught a taxi to the consulate. I asked them
some questions about visas and was dumbfounded at how ridiculous the
situation was with Tien's visa. It was such a load of bullshit I thought
there had to be another way to do it. She said I had to go to American
and file for Tien's visa there. This was astonishing because I was not
in America, nor did I have the time or money to fly there. This was the
first bit of a mountain of bullshit concerning American visas for
Vietnamese citizens. I left the consulate thoroughly pissed off at how
asinine the situation was and had a new perspective on what Mexicans
probably have to put up with frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back to the bus station, got on a crowded and hot bus and headed
to Binh Duong. I tried to sleep but ended up just marinating in sweat.
We exited the bus and I continued marinating while standing on the
sidewalk, then I was chilled for a few minutes inside a taxi, and
marinated again on another sidewalk and on the back of a scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Mai's friends house I took a shower. The first thing
I did when I got in the shower was break the handle off the water faucet
in the bath. I have a real knack for breaking things, and it really
shines over here in Asia. After showering we ate a small meal to hold us
over until we got a better meal, then went out for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soon was grateful that I ate that little meal, because the sight of
half of a cooked dog hanging by his teeth in the market right outside
our guest house destroyed my appetite. I was also glad I had eaten eggs
since they are unmistakeable. Mai's friend was a slick kind of show off
guy who liked to have fun, so later on when we were eating I half
expected him to say &amp;quot;that's not chicken, it's dog!&amp;quot; Then I thought &amp;quot;so
what if it is? It tastes good...&amp;quot; As far as I know though, I never ate
any dog meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got dark and we went to sleep with the intention of waking up the
next day, but ended up getting up after an hour or so to sing some
karaoke. There are never any english songs in the karaoke books so I
mainly get to watch other people sing. Tien sings Camly songs and people
say she looks like her too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After karaoke we did end up going to sleep. On the floor. It was
probably the worst night of sleep I've ever had. It's certainly the
worst night of sleep I can remember, but who knows, maybe I blocked out
the really bad nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning Tien gave me a massage to help my aching back, then we
walked to breakfast. We walked like 15 blocks. I didn't mind though
because I was hoping to get away from the market where they were selling
dog meat. We had pho and of course I wondered what that meat was...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, Tien, Mai and I caught a taxi to Đại Nam Văn Hiến, a
safari style theme park inside of big castle walls, complete with its
own real temple, a few artificial mountains, and all sorts of other
assorted fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did was get on a train and go to hell. Or rather, a
haunted house style thing inside of 5 big chinese dragon heads that was
like a trip through hell. It was so dark inside that my eyes never fully
adjusted. It had ghouls flying at you in the air, from behind cages,
people grabbing at your legs in the dark, and tons of voices screaming,
crying and shouting in Vietnamese. I thought about the Vietnam war and
S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3702742453/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Đại Nam Văn Hiến Temple Gate" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2528/3702742453_373b7e5c58_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The next thing we did was rent a tandem
bicycle. Two seats and two sets of pedals for three of us, complete with
a triple ring in front and seven in the back. I didn't have much trouble
working the bike and it felt good to be back on a bike since I love
biking and haven't done it in over two months. We biked to the temple
and went inside. It was a big compound with water fountains and a very
large room for the temple itself. It was probably the largest temple
I've been in and it was nice that it was real, not just some tourist
attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We biked around some more and I took a bunch of photos and then we went
to an Italian restaurant and got food. I got an incorrectly made but
delicious club sandwich. Tien got some of the worst spaghetti I've ever
tasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked out the go-kart track that was near the restaurant, but Tien
didn't want to race so I didn't bother. It was a neat track in a figure
8 with a bridge over the intersection, the first I'd seen for go-karts.
The cars were minimal, and they didn't seem to give anybody any training
on how they worked before throwing them on the track. It looked fun, but
instead of that we went to Snow Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty skeptical of snow land, it was over 90ºF outside. They gave
us rain boots, jackets and gloves, but no hat. Then they let us inside
to snow land, a freezing cold sledding hill with an assortment of tubes.
I couldn't believe there was actual ice created by these air
conditioners when it was so hot outside. I quickly got very cold without
a hat, but Tien and I had fun sledding down a few times. She had never
seen real snow, and technically she still hasn't since this was some of
the worst spring snow you've ever seen. Still, it was entertaining and
fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was late in the afternoon so we headed back to guest house and hung
out for the evening, figuring out our travel plans. For some reason we
decided to take a 1am bus to Binh Hoa instead of a 5pm bus. I decided to
get some sleep before then since I can never sleep on those buses.&lt;/p&gt;

would be great because I could call Tien using my Cambodian SIM card and
let her know that my flight was an hour late, but she didn't pick up. We
were on the ground for about 15 minutes, then I boarded the same
airplane in the same seat and we flew away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with arrival and departure cards for passport control, the spread
of H1N1 has prompted governments to require incoming visitors to fill
out questionnaires about the state of their health. Previously the
questions had been something like &amp;quot;Have you had dizziness, cough,
diarrhea, fever, nausea within the last 10 days? What countries have you
visited in the last 10 days?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ho Chi Minh airport has had the most outbreaks of H1N1 that I've
heard of yet which explains their additional diligence. &amp;quot;Have you come
in contact with anybody who has had fever, cough, diarrhea, nausea
within the last 15 days.&amp;quot; I couldn't even remember everywhere I'd slept
in the last 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to find the slowest line at passport control. This is
something I have a real knack for. I also had done this in Thailand when
I was trying to catch a flight that was already boarding and in Laos
with the whole pen incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was walking outside I felt distinctly different from the last few
times I was in Saigon and I thought about how much I'd done in the past
few weeks that had given me a new confidence in international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked outside Tien was waiting for me in a black blouse and a
white skirt, looking beautiful and beaming with joy. I never quite know
how I'm supposed to express my feelings within cultural affection
allowances, but I managed to find something that was acceptable to show
my joy at having her back. She grabbed her sister Mai, who I was not
expecting to see, and we went off to find a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was where my travel experience came in handy. I cut through the
timidness that Tien has, kicked the first taxi driver to the curb and
found a ride to the hydrofoil station at a quarter the cost. This is
what you learn from getting ripped off at the Saigon airport. &amp;quot;Fool me
once, shame on ... shame on you. If you fool me... We can't get fooled
again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to the hydrofoil station and I was quickly reminded how utterly
chaotic Saigon traffic is. Smoggy, loud, and chaotic. What sense is
there in calmly walking across a six lane river of continuously flowing
traffic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought our hydrofoil tickets for the Vina Express to Vũng Tàu, but it
wasn't leaving for over two hours, so we found a place to sit and wait
while drinking coffee and eating some noodles. Then it began to rain.
Then it began to pour. Then we realized that we would miss the glorious
sunset we'd hoped to see from the hydrofoil just as we were to arrive in
Vũng Tàu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrofoil was awesome and pretty freakin quick. It skimmed over the
water and made big splashes up onto the window. It was also very agile
in the water, so agile that sometimes we thought it'd tip over, but it
skimmed by tug boats and ferries and barges and oil rigs down the Saigon
River and off into the pacific ocean. A girl came by and told us that
because of the weather there were oceanic problems at the port so we'd
have to go to a different port and take a bus into town. This frustrated
us beyond the mere absence of a sunset, but that's how travel goes in
these places. There was also the standard TV display of random
entertainment and most of what we saw was some weird kung fu movie with
four people who would wring out a shirt and drink water from it, then
use it as a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right at dusk we pulled up near a dock in an industrial area a little
ways up a calm river just south of Vũng Tàu. It was still gently raining
as they made us climb over 3 ships with no planks between them while
carrying our bags to get to the actual dock. Tien was still wearing her
nice clothes but we managed to cross with few issues. She admitted that
she'd dressed poorly for traveling because she wanted to look nice for
my return and this was fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us managed to pile into a bus and fill it completely up while
others remained outside in the rain haggling with taxi drivers. Soon it
was completely dark, the rain had returned to a pour and we were stuck
on a one lane dirt road behind a car that had no driver. I was reminded
of those idiots in SF who double park on the train tracks and lock their
car then disappear inside of a building. One time I sat on a train for
30 minutes while they towed the car. This time it only lasted 5 minutes
though, which was nice because traveling can really wear you out and I'd
been traveling all day and had already been off schedule twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the bus drop off and stood under an awning at the local
KFC while people tried to figure out where they were going to stay, then
tried to find taxis to take them there. It's interesting having people
who speak the language with you because they can actually get useful
information, but this information is rarely passed on to you. I kept
flipping back and forth between &amp;quot;let me handle this&amp;quot; mode and &amp;quot;you
handle this&amp;quot; mode. In the end Mai found us a place next door to the
house of a girl who was trying to find a taxi, so the four of us got in
the taxi and headed off. It appeared to be nowhere near the beach by the
time we got there on the back streets, but in fact ended up being only
two blocks from the beach. We dropped our stuff in the room, took a
little rest and went off to find dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we walked down to the beach. It was great to finally be
there... aside from the fact that the waves on the shore were lined with
trash, it was beautiful. With Tien on my back we waded about 50 feet out
into the warm water and stood there watching the lightning storm that
was going on way out in the Eastern Pacific. It felt great to be back at
the ocean. I had been by the ocean for the previous year and a half
while living in San Francisco, but in the previous two months I was away
from it and it was great to have it back. Even more, it was great to be
in warm water as opposed to the cold SF Pacific, and it was great to
have my girl with me to experience the lightning show, which was
reminiscent. It was, I guess, a mix between old good memories and new
joys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day we got breakfast and then headed out to a large
Christian monument on top of a hill just south of the strip where we
were staying. This was the first real Christian anything I'd seen on my
trip. There wasn't a word of english or french on any of the plaques so
I have no idea what it was about, but there were angels and moses and
cupids and at the top of the walkway up the hill, a huge statue of Jesus
with his arms outstretched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the top of the hill I was drenched in sweat. I sat with Tien and
talked about some of the hardships we faced in getting married and
bringing her back to the USA. There are a few big hurdles to pass this
month and I wanted to make sure she was still with me on all of our
plans. She was, so we were happy. Her sister arrived with a bag of fruit
after we'd been there a while, so the three of us sat and ate lychee and
rambutan. We stayed at the top for a while, then headed back down the
hill and off to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to clean up and go swimming, but the climb up the hill and
the heat of the day had wiped us out, so we ended up falling asleep for
an hour or two. This was fine though, we needed it, and afterwards we
headed down to the beach. We found three chairs to rent and Mai stayed
to watch our things while Tien and I ran off to go play in the water. As
it turns out, swimming is not one of the things that is taught in
Vietnamese school. Later I had a good conversation with Tien about the
differences between an average first world education and an average
third world education. The fact that Vietnam is about halfway covered
with water yet they don't teach swimming blew my mind. Tien said that 15
students had died the previous year from drowning while riding a boat to
school in heavy rains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of swimming education made Tien terribly frightened by the
waves and it took me a while to chase her through the water and coax her
out past the breakers to where the water was more calm. Unfortunately
she couldn't always touch the ground out there. She had seen a photo I
took in Ha Long Bay of a boy floating on his back and wondered how he
could do that, so I taught her how and in typical Tien style, she
learned very quickly. In 15 minutes she was floating on her own as large
waves that were on their way to breaking passed her by. We ended the
swim lesson, took a few minutes to enjoy the water and the fact that we
were finally traveling together, then headed back to the shore to let
Mai have her turn in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were women walking around with eggs and fish and baskets
containing metal cans with fire that was boiling water where they would
cook you fresh seafood. Many women were walking around with baskets of
fresh fruit, and some guy was riding his bicycle by with a huge speaker
system on it that made me think of the pillow fight in SF this year. A
few people rode down the beach on their scooters. A group of kids next
to us had collected a few dozen shells with crabs inside of them and as
we were leaving one of the crabs tried to walk its way off the table. A
man nearby picked it up before it got off the table and showed it to the
group of friends he was sitting with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mai, Tien and I headed back to the hotel. The path to the beach is a
typical Vietnamese path, which means it is free to ride scooters on and
do whatever else you feel like doing on. Some kids were parked on their
scooter talking on the phone. One woman was cooking up some weird fish
that looked like a flat octopus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day was Monday, but still Sunday in the USA which means I still
had time to post my weekly photo set, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dreamnotoftoday.com/?p=2989"&gt;The
(d)SPOT&lt;/a&gt;. Because there was
an elevator shaft between our room and the AP, I had to sit in the hall
next to the elevator to do my work. I caught up with some co-workers and
did other assorted online stuff as I was posting my photos. Just as I
was finishing up and saying goodbye to some folks, the power went out.
At first I thought the AC had just gone off, but then my internet
connection was interrupted. I finally verified that it was indeed the
power being out by checking the elevator, which was nonfunctional. I
thought about how awful it would be to be trapped in an elevator in a
small hotel in a third world country and was thankful that I was not.&lt;/p&gt;

opening, Thursday morning I went to find a better option, an option with
Internet. That is vital if you want to stay in touch with people who are
scattered around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked into a nice looking guesthouse with a huge bed in a pretty
good looking room. I signed on to catch up with photos and whatnot and
discovered that even though there was wifi, the actual Internet
connection was glacial. It was reminiscent of the 14.4 days. Facebook
took over 15 minutes to load. Ping times to google were Averaging 5000ms
over 20 hops with 8% packet loss and an MTU of 1100. This was
terrible...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, as the day warmed up there began a breeze that crept in
through the window leading out to the tiny alley, bringing with it a
pungent aroma of pestilence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was mid day so I left the stench and went for a walk. Just as I was
photographing some stuff and fearing getting rained on a nice tuk tuk
driver came up and offered to take me to some local sites that were
photogenic. He had photos of the places and they were indeed grand so I
agreed and jumped in the back of his tuk tuk. Off we went, the tuk tuk
bumping and whining all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clouds went away without raining and left a hot, humid day. The
skies were beautiful blue with an assortment of scattered clouds. I was
soon drenched in sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw four locations and miraculously ended up by my hotel. I went
inside to clean up and cool off, then went to find dinner. I also had to
figure out what to do in Laos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a restaurant where some kid on the way out said the food was good
and ended up being wrong.  Soon after sitting down a local girl started
talking to me and invited me to sit with her. I obliged but soon
regretted it. She could barely speak conversational English, seemed
mentally vacant and just wanted to go to a bar. Soon after sitting down
a man came by and offered me Viagra. I paid for my food and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did go to a bar though. I had a delicious cocktail and chatted with
some backpackers from the UK. They suggested that I go to Veng Viang and
showed me photos from the previous day. It was gorgeous and I thought
that I'd like to go. Then they said it was a party town and I thought
twice. It was gorgeous though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been in Asia for a month so far and was finally getting a bit
tired of traveling. I'm not sure if it was loneliness or exhaustion, but
it was probably a bit of both. I was tired of having to look so far past
the defacto tourist bullshit to find things actually worth doing.
Photographing Veng Viang was definitely worth doing, but in the end I
decided to fly back to Vietnam to be with Tien and go to Vung Tau beach,
something we had wanted to do previously but were unable to do. I was a
little bummed about not getting to spend more time in Laos, but the
world has a lot to see and I can always come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I checked out of the stinky slow internet room and went to
secure my airfare to Vietnam. I couldn't get a ticket for that same day
so I got one for Saturday and went to find my third hotel in Vientiane.
This was half the price of the last, had a window looking across a
street to a temple and had no Internet. There was an Internet cafe right
next door though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/6020772190/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Third Hotel" class="align-left" src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6138/6020772190_4bc2647826_n.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To access the Internet you were supposed to go buy an access card, then
log into their web portal and enter the info to get access. I really
didn't feel like leaving my hotel room and took this as another claw
sharpening tech challenge. Within a few minutes I'd found an open HTTP
proxy within their network and used it to get online. The access was
much much faster than my previous accommodations but had limitations on
allowed protocols. It was fine for my needs and I spent the next few
hours trying to circumvent the protocol limitations. I never got
anywhere with it, but it was a good exercise and it was good to know
that my skills hadn't dulled in the last month of unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got hungry so I went back to the full moon cafe where I'd met the UK
backpackers. This place was a branch of the Cambodian Boom Boom Room, a
media store specializing in the illicit sale of music and movies to
travelers at terribly low prices. One album was $1.50. I bought 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel there was smoke in the air as the monks across the
street burned leaves they had raked up. This morning, July 4th, they
woke me up with drumming and chanting. I think monks may not be great
neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a delicious breakfast I checked out, found a tuk tuk and headed
for the airport. My short stay I Laos is pretty much over, save waiting
for my currently delayed flight. I like it here though and I'd like to
come back some day and go farther in. Today though it's airplanes, my
girl, a hydrofoil and a beach.&lt;/p&gt;

the mini fridge stocked with soda, water and local beer. They're nice
enough to have an air conditioner, but not nice enough to have free
wifi. There's a shower, but no bath tub. Along with the bidet they do
provide toilet paper, but you're not allowed to flush it down the
toilet. Instead you have to put it in a little bucket. My bucket came
with some already used tissues and a used condom. This bathroom has two
tiny extras: a phone in the bathroom next to the toilet and a clothes
rack on the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice constant on my month-long trip has been the availability of
american power plugs. They're not always grounded plugs, but there are
always plugs. The ones that aren't grounded sometimes make your gear
sting you with a tiny flow of stray electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in Laos at the Douang Deuane hotel in Vientiane. This was the 4th
place I had to try before I found an open room. My room wraps in an L
around the elevator shaft, but it's quiet so far. I'm on the 4th floor
which is second to the top. You can find me in room 404.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to check into a hotel that has 4 digit room numbers, let
alone get lucky with room 2046.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room 410 would've been mildly amusing too, and if I had Tien here we
might have had to play charades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me 5 modes of transportation to get here: taxi, motorbike,
train, car, and airplane. I was somewhat hoping for a sixth being a tuk
tuk, but you can't win them all. I suppose the sixth could be my feet
since I had to wander around in the dark of night looking for a place to
sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was Tuesday and My had school. We caught a taxi to the Sky
Train in Bangkok and she went off to class leaving me to do what I
wished in Bangkok. I took some photos and soon got lost inside of an
enormous mall next to six or seven other enormous malls located in Siam
Square. I basically wandered around and took some photos and gawked at
all the different things. I tried to find some photography gear that was
decently priced but everything was just slightly more expensive than in
America. I wonder if photographers in Thailand are inherently better
because of the higher cost of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3671787654/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Anoontakaroons" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2462/3671787654_a1f2a0f5d3_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That night Mint and I sat up watching The Usual
Suspects on Thai TV. They blurred out guns pointed at people at point
blank. They blurred out people smoking. They blurred out people's lips
when they said certain thing. They let you hear every cuss word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I looked at my schedule and decided that I better get a move on
and get out of Thailand. I was enjoying the company of My and her
family, but I was longing for the freedom and the lifestyle that comes
with it. I also only have a few days left until I need to be back in
Saigon and I have a whole country to see. With that in mind I logged
onto ye handy internette and bought a plane ticket to Laos, surprising
My and spoiling her day at school. She called her friend to answer her
name and fill out her homework for her, then spent the day with me. We
once again performed our taxi and sky train maneuver to get downtown,
then got coffee and headed off for the backpacker district, Khaosan
Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaosan Road is just about everything I hate about backpacker culture,
all wrapped into a very long block. We were only there for 90 minutes,
but that was plenty time to see what there was to see. I could go on and
on about how much BS there is there, and I plan to do so over at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dreamnotoftoday.com"&gt;Dream
Not of Today&lt;/a&gt; where I post photos and
from time to time write logical criticisms of culture, other assorted
diatribes and whatever else fits the edgy dynamic of that site rather
than the personal angle of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we hit the road in a taxi that went so slow we both
fell asleep and woke up 1 block later. My paid the 45 minute 100 baht
fee that took us around 2 sides of a single city block, and we walked.
We had to do something, I was now 45 minutes late for my projected
timeframe of going to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A block or so later she found us some motorbike taxis. This was not only
a fantastic way to kill the 5km of gridlocked traffic between us and the
sky train, but it was reminiscent of Vietnam, the country where four
days from now I will return into the arms of my fiancé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3680976432/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Siam Square transit" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2449/3680976432_aec22433bb_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took the two us through gridlocked traffic on that
motorbike the way I'd handle just myself on a bicycle, which is more
aggressive than most, passing between cars and taxis and buses like he
was navigating a maze and knew the way through. We used the oncoming
lane to pass hundreds of cars. We ran gridlocked red lights with police
sitting right there or doing the same thing on their motorbikes in the
opposite direction. We passed a traffic cop stopping cars that would
otherwise have a clear shot and hit 50km on the open 5 lane road and
were passed only by a CBR 150 before diving back into the gridlock. We
passed through more maze like traffic, turned down and alley and went
through a parking structure and ended up right at the stairwell for the
sky train. Why did we ever get into that stationary air conditioned
automobile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about how there are never any traffic jams in Vietnam unless
there are automobiles involved. I shared this thought with My. Later on
that night her dad would share the same thoughts with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off the sky train, got into a taxi and got stuck in traffic again
and I loathed the automobile. I wondered how on earth so many cars could
contain so many drivers that were so fucking stupid as to sit there in
the street burning up and smoking dead dinosaurs when they ought to be
going somewhere at a very rapid pace. I thought back to when I first
bought a motorcycle in San Jose in order to cut through traffic and give
up the sitting and dinosaur smoking lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually got home, I packed as fast as I could, which gets harder
every time I buy a bamboo flute or a man purse or a pair of broken
swimming shorts, piled into her dads car and headed off to the airport.
I arrived at the airport 45 minutes before the plane left. I got my
ticket 30 minutes before the plane left. I got through passport control
and security 15 minutes before my plane left. I got to my seat on the
plane 10 minutes before my plane left. I didn't know things could go so
well after going so badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight was nice, I was nearly asleep when they gave me a delicious
meal and a small pour of wine. I listened to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Orbital/_/Halcyon%2B%252B%2BOn%2B%252B%2BOn"&gt;Halcyon + On +
On&lt;/a&gt;
and One Perfect Sunrise. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.loopz.co.uk/"&gt;Orbital&lt;/a&gt; is always
great traveling music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got off the plane I still hadn't filled out my arrival card,
which is standard procedure on the plane in order to make passport
control quicker. There were no pens, so I just went to the line and
stood there. The man turned me away to go fill it out at the desk where
there were no pens, so I went. There were about 7 people standing around
sharing a single pen. It belonged to an Asian man of a descent I
couldn't discern, but he gave it to me when everybody was done with it
and walked away with his wife and child. I filled out my stuff and left
the pen there as goodwill, but then thought I should've done differently
when I ended up next to him in line. He didn't care, he just smiled and
waved it off. It was late and we were tired, who cared about a pen? It's
always good to have smiles and laughs from strangers, and there's
something extra when there's no other communication beyond the
rudimentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed my remaining Baht to Kip. Kip is another currency with 4 or 5
trailing zeros. My taxi ride to the hotel was 52,000. I got dropped off
by the waterfront of the river that separates Thailand and Laos, so
basically I was only a few hundred meters into the fourth country on my
journey. The hotel I had found in the guidebook was full. The place next
door was full. I had predicted this and had scoped out a few places on
the way in. They were also full, including the one that had wifi. I had
picked the right neighborhood though and the 5th or 6th place I went had
a room open, and that is where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Beerlao. I'm not sure if the beer here is great just because I
haven't been drinking as frequently, of if it's just better, but beer
here in Asia is nice. Maybe it's the property of ones being applied to a
heat factor that is well above what I'm used to. Anyhow, I'm safe and
sound in Laos. I have 4 days here, then it's back to Saigon to be with
my fiancé and handle visa stuff for her trip to America with me. Beyond
that, I'm not sure how my trip is going to go, but I think I will only
be able to see Malaysia and not Singapore. Perhaps I can shift in a
different sixth country to make up for it...&lt;/p&gt;

This
was a collection of historical buildings. There were many buildings
called mansions that were as small as a large apartment. Like many
important buildings, you had to take your shoes off. And you weren't
supposed to use your cell phone. And you couldn't take pictures. All I
could think of was &amp;quot;no fun allowed&amp;quot;, and that may have been the case
since it wasn't really a fun place, but just an ornate and awe inspiring
place with a rich history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch at a restaurant above a river where big collections of
plants were floating by. Afterwards we went to a few more temples, then
drove home in the rain with a beautiful sunset beyond the scattered
towers of Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw somebody living under a bridge in a makeshift tent with laundry
hung out to dry and pictures hung from the laundry wires and posted on
the wall of the underpass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning My and I got up and caught a taxi to the Sky Train and
headed downtown to Siam Square. This was a big departure from what I've
been used to as it involved things that weren't hundreds of years old.
It was a modern train and modern buildings with modern fashion and chain
restaurants.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3675543388/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mall shapes" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2450/3675543388_1b421b604e_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There were people going to work in suits and
hundreds of school kids dressed in uniforms. There were big theaters
with laser lights in the lobby playing techno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a collection of malls, not just a single mall. It was like six
malls, all over 6 stories tall. There was so much fashion to shop for I
don't know if some of the girls back home would've come out alive. At
one point we found ourselves in a market area on one floor filled
entirely of mobile phones. I'd never seen so many mobile phones in my
life. Literally there were thousands and thousands of mobile phones
being sold at hundreds of little shops that were all exactly the same. I
thought I was in tech purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one store I saw what I thought was an iPhone for a really cheap
price, so I asked to see it. It was a fake. It looked almost exactly
like an iPhone, but it had a micro USB slot instead of a dock slot. And
it took two SIM cards. And it had a replaceable battery. And the OS
sucked. And it required a stylus. And you had to go into the ugly
preferences to configure things like UART. It made me wonder why on
earth people would go to such lengths to copy merely the physical style
of the iPhone yet miss all of the functionality in the user experience,
which is where the money is. But then I looked at those oceans of Nokia,
Ericsson and Samsung phones and thought &amp;quot;Apple has no market here
anyway...&amp;quot; Then I thought &amp;quot;an app store for something like Nokia would
be a huge boon for the Asian market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a guy with a shirt that said &amp;quot;I fantasize about the ups man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl with a shirt that said &amp;quot;I look good when turned upside
down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a man on the street with no shirt wearing ripped up shorts and
gold high heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home in the Sky Train I told My about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1103326&amp;#64;N23/pool/"&gt;Bart Swing
2009&lt;/a&gt;. The Sky Train
is too crowded to actually do something like that, but that didn't stop
us from dreaming up the next iteration on the idea... Sky Cradle 2009™,
the best way to catch up on your sleep while commuting home.&lt;/p&gt;

had been in India for work and arrived while I was sleeping. She was
really nice and outgoing and made me feel at home. She was the only one
I'd e-mailed with about my visit and it was nice to finally meet her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to go see Wat Arun, the Emerald Buddha and The Reclining
Buddha. It was My, Max, Ratana, Ratana's sister Jit and I. We got
breakfast at the usual and then headed off down the tollway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tollway reminded me of the new I-25 through Denver. Wide tarmac,
smooth, and the scattered tall buildings were similar to those by the
DTC. The city is also very sprawled out like Denver is but more so.
What's different is that the skyscrapers are scattered around as far as
you can see instead of mostly grouped together. Traffic was different
too. Everywhere I go in Asia it seems like the lines on the street are
just suggestions of one way to do things. When traffic got heavy on the
tollway people turned the shoulder into a lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of tall buildings near the tollway, but there were also
a lot of shacks cobbled together, some with tin roofs and no glass in
the windows. Igor had mentioned that there were a lot of run down, poor
areas like this and I hadn't seen many yet, but here they were next to
the highway on the way to downtown. This was more like the SE Asia I
knew for the first few weeks I was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed through the edge of downtown and I got a quick glance at it.
It seemed like a normal big city with people playing sports in lots
underneath the highway, people waiting for buses, people doing this and
that in public places. I thought about how I'd go crazy here with a
camera between the people and the expansive urban landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic surrounding downtown was terrible in some places and I thought
it was normal until Ratana said that it was because the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/11/content_11168588.htm"&gt;Red
Shirts&lt;/a&gt;
were protesting today near The Palace, which is where we were headed. We
would be taking a boat though and would miss the streets where they were
protesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got lost and I instinctually pulled out my iPhone to look at the map,
and for the first time since leaving San Francisco it actually worked.
The GPS function in my iPhone found us in Bangkok. This further
validated my suspicion that it was at least somewhat dependent on the
mobile network and not entirely dependent on the actual global
positioning system run by the US government as most GPS units are. I
used it to find geocaches nearby, one of which was exactly where My and
I had gotten lost near the King's museum the other evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3664778017/"&gt;&lt;img alt="This thing points upwards" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3664778017_7b2b140450_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 161px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We found our way to Wat Arun. We had a look
around the complex and went up as high as you could go on the temple.
This provided great views of the surrounding complex, the river, the
temples across the river where the Emerald Buddha and Reclining Buddha
were, and far off sights like downtown and other skyscrapers scattered
around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we went down to the river and caught a boat to the other side
of the river. River taxis are common here like buses are in some
cities. We went through a little market area and walked along next to
the palace complex until we got to the front where all of the rest of
the tourists were. We went in and saw our way through the sites. I'd
love to have something to say here, but most of what was inside were
historically significant things specifically related to Buddhism, and
I've never been good at history and Buddhist history seems really
complex. It was all very beautiful though and I took many photos that
I'm happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratana bought a book for me about the history of the Emerald Buddha. It
was discovered when lightning struck a building. It is made out of Jade,
emerald is just the translated word for the color of jade. It's been
moved around a lot. It's been owned by several different SE Asian
countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left and went to a mall to get some dinner and so some shopping. The
parking lot was really full. So full that aside from the normal american
H style parking where cars park end to end two at a time, there was a
third row of cars perpendicular to those cars, boxing in the middle
cars. I wondered how the hell the boxed in cars would get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3667055820/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bangkok mall construction" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3546/3667055820_005444546b_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here's how. The perpendicular cars are left
in neutral. People who need to get to their cars find a parking lot
attendant to help them or by their self roll the car out of the way.
This is what we did to get to a parking spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went inside and found a sukiyaki restaurant. Mint joined us and we
had dinner, then went shopping. The mall was great, the stores were a
lot different than American malls. There were market areas similar to
the market I saw in Hanoi. There was a Dell shop, a Fujitsu shop, camera
boutiques, phone boutiques, and then the usual things like clothes and
shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked for a replacement GPS for my camera, which was still mostly
dysfunctional, but found nothing. I got a messenger bag that I should've
got a month ago, some swimming trunks that I also should've gotten
several weeks ago, and was unable to find a hat that fit. My head is
just too big...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home again. Geeking out again. Slept.&lt;/p&gt;

songbirds outside, which has so far been absent from my Asian trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Jackson had died while I was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody was gone from the house except Max. I had coffee and a muffin
and caught up with an old friend, Aimee Rich, who I hadn't talked to
since high school. It's interesting to get the summary of somebody's
life and to summarize my own. &amp;quot;I went to college for a semester, dropped
out, worked in tech hardware manufacturing for a few years, was a video
editor for about 6 months, then started my career in computer technology
which took me from Colorado to California. I recently quit my job to
travel around SE Asia and am about to marry a Vietnamese girl and take
her back to America with me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went for breakfast and had a typical Asian breakfast in that it was
no different from any other meal. Thai iced coffee is delicious. The
menu was in English, as are many many things in Bangkok. My had said
that almost everybody here speaks English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Max about his career and he said he had been in IT, mainly
Oracle, and retired at 48. He's 54 now and plays stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were on our way to The Ancient City and drove for a while. Bangkok is
a very spread out city. I've noticed that there are many five story
apartment buildings, some with pillars and balconies. These building are
like an entire San Francisco block as a single building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered what it would take for Saigon or Long Xuyen to become a city
like Bangkok. Hanoi is already halfway there. Bangkok has very little
litter and I've seen people cleaning up on the side of the road. There
are several driving ranges nearby. There are many carson the road and a
stellar tollway system. Traffic in Bangkok is still a little crazy, just
in cars rather than on scooters. There is graffiti done by locals rather
than foreigners. I saw men in a water tanker watering plants in the
median of a boulevard. It's not that I want Saigon or Long Xuyen to be
Bangkok, it's just interesting to consider the steps between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3663094398/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Oriented" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2580/3663094398_355e30615c_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We arrived at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ancientcity.com/"&gt;The Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;,
or Ancient Siam, which is a collection of large scale replicas of famous
sites in Thailand. They are smaller than the originals, but still large
enough to walk into. We got two bicycles to ride around. They both had
baskets on the front which turned out to be a great setup for easy
camera use. The sights were cool and it was an easy way to get a feel
for what Thailand had to offer. Many of the temples were familiar as I'd
already been tromping around Angkor. I took a lot of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a turtle running across the street and would've missed seeing it
had it not been for the sounds his feet were making as they scraped the
street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the car and headed off. I saw a sign that said simply
&amp;quot;Modify Dog&amp;quot; and thought of Repet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a local mall to figure out some issues with my phone's data
plan. When I got my SIM card it came with a data plan, which I was
unaware of, and my automatic e-mail drained most of the balance in my
account. I turned off the auto e-mail check but still needed to fix the
balance and the data plan. I gave them 100 baht more, which is about $3,
and got 6 hours of data with 50 baht more for calling. This way of doing
things makes so much sense it's a shame that it's not more prominent in
America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also stopped off at a few shops to look at camera gear. The D700 is
just as expensive here as it is in America, and the LX3 is just as hard
to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed home. I decided to try out Skype on my data plan and was
incredibly disappointed to find that the Skype app on my iPhone was
preventing me from making phone calls &amp;quot;due to contractual agreements&amp;quot;
that did not apply to my circumstances. Damn poorly programmed software,
damn AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after we arrived home My came walking tiredly in and showed us
her fresh new driver's license. 20 years old and finally able to drive.
Max had told me earlier that she would probably get the nice 2006 Toyota
SUV we've been cruising around town in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint also came home soon and we all went to dinner at the same
restaurant we had dinner at last night and breakfast this morning. The
food is great, the drinks are good. At the back of the restaurant one of
the employees was changing her baby's diaper. On TV there were
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/27/content_11609580.htm"&gt;elephants dressed up like panda
bears&lt;/a&gt;,
then they were lifting a yak out of an oil change pit at a gas station
that it had fallen into, then a yak gave birth to a baby yak, then they
were testing cell phones for lightning attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yak birth is not appropriate dinner media, and cell phones do not
attract lightning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TVs here support multiple audio channels and some shows broadcast in
both Thai and English. You can switch between them just like a DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have pizza delivery motorbikes. I'm going to take this idea back to
San Francisco and make a million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl at a bus stop with a t-shirt that said &amp;quot;I &amp;lt;3 6/9&amp;quot;. That
date has no significance in Thailand so I assumed it was a sexual
engrish t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a nearby park where there are waterways, big grass lawns and
the Kings museum where you can read blurbs about the king and see what
kind of things he's into. As we approached the museum a man blew a
whistle and everybody in the park stood up. &amp;quot;National song.&amp;quot; We all
stood there, most with their hands at their sides as the custom goes,
until the song was over, then we all returned to what we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw the museum. The King seems like a great man, great leader and a
great role model for a well rounded lifestyle. My and I went for a walk
around the park as the sun was setting. We found a Chinese garden and
inside of the garden I found a very large weird animal which I thoguht
was a baby crocodile but ended up being an ant eater. We saw several
more ant eaters swimming around and got lost in the park while we were
looking at them and talking about animals. We found our way home, found
her sister and father and went home for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about the next few weeks and about what I'll do with my time.
The dynamic change between backpacking solo and being a hosted guest is
pretty significant. As a backpacker you can go where you want when you
want and do what you want, but as a hosted guest there is a shift
towards group outings and to the lifestyle of those hosting you. It's an
interesting shift and it's easy to lose sight of the fact that you are
in fact traveling. I don't want to outstay my welcome or expire the
hospitality of my hosts, and I want to continue my travels to northern
Thailand and Laos. I have 9 days until I need to be back in Saigon to
meet Tien. I really need to figure out a tentative schedule...&lt;/p&gt;

able to jailbreak my iPhone and install network unlocking software on it
which would enable me to use it as a phone outside of AT&amp;amp;T's network. I
downloaded the tools to do this and did so while I was also diagnosing
and reconfiguring the shoddy wifi signals at my hotel. I was able to
successfully unlock my phone while doing nearly all I could do with the
wifi network in order to make access at least a little more than non
existent to the 4th floor. There was still one huge core change I wanted
to make but didn't want to risk taking down the upper floor networks due
to inaccessible 802.11 APs which were acting as chained repeaters rather
than point-to-multipoint bridges, which would've been more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I had chat and e-mail worthy and nearly web surf worthy
wireless access in my room, and a jailbroken and unlocked iPhone 3g.
With that completed, I headed out to get dinner and to find a SIM card
to test out the network unlock. I was already to select from a list of
about 10 carriers, but my AT&amp;amp;T card wasn't working on any of them so
they were no more use than information on what was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got dinner at a chain restaurant I've seen around here called NYDC
which serves east coast American food and offers free wifi to its
patrons. I had pizza and my first glass of wine in nearly a month as I
played with Cydia, which was somewhere between the glory of my first
jailbreak experience and the horror of my second. Some of the things I
wanted weren't immediately available, like iPhysics and Trism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner I walked around looking for SIM cards and ended up at the
Siem Reap night market, which was just like the day market but more cozy
and warm and quiet, but with still the same &amp;quot;hello sir, can i help you
sir, you buy a t-shirt sir&amp;quot; people. I was offered about 50 tuk tuk rides
that I didn't need, motorbike rides which was maybe a first for Cambodia
but was frequent in Vietnam, weed and cocaine among countless trinkets
and novelties. I was really just out to see it though, just to verify
that there wasn't anything worth seeing beyond the experience of having
visited the night markets in Cambodia. Many people were having fun
bartering and buying, but progressive minimalists like myself had no
business in a place like that. With that in mind I went to a market,
bought a bottle of Singha and an international SIM card and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed up late chatting with Tien and friends who were waking up on
the other side of the planet. Unfortunately I wasn't able to open the
tray that held my AT&amp;amp;T SIM card, so I wasn't able to try it out. That
was OK though, in time I'd figure it out. It was more of an educational
experience anyway, I didn't really need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning I woke and chatted, listened to music, which had
surprisingly been missing in my entire Siem Reap experience, showered
and headed out for the much needed coffee and breakfast. I found a
restaurant I wished I'd have found a few days earlier. It was a little
hole in the wall stall across the street from the more ritzy western
restaurants, and they had bread, eggs and white coffee for $2. I was
delighted. I also managed to find a cool trick to get the SIM tray on an
iPhone open without using a paperclip. Just shove a round toothpick into
the hole snugly, then pull the tray out. There is enough grip to open
the tray, and so I was able to swap my SIM and being trying out this
Asian mobile scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't figure it out. I forgot which provider was mine, and the girl
at the restaurant didn't know the logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting tired of Siem Reap and wanted to leave, so I wandered a
block and found a travel agency to check out what options I had for
leaving. It turned out I could leave to Bangkok in 3 hours for $145. I
went back to my hotel, grabbed my passport and three $50's, checked the
SIM card provider info I'd gotten, headed back to the travel agency to
buy my ticket and on the way saw a man at a fruit stand showing a tiny
~.22 caliber pistol to a local boy of about 13. What followed was a
hurried series of events which involved me paying for my ticket and
handing over my passport, hiring a tuk tuk driver to take me back to the
hotel and wait, packing my bags as fast as I could because it was
exactly check out time and I had to be at the airport in 30 minutes,
checking out, going back to the travel agency to pick up my ticket and
passport and then heading straight to the airport. To top it off, my tuk
tuk driver barely spoke english and drove a slow tuk tuk which was
passed by more than one on the way to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy though. The rush was a little bit of excitement in my very
lazy Cambodian experience, and I was finally leaving Siem Reap. It was a
western town with lounges and western restaurants and expensive drinks
and meals. I was tired of not being able to look people in the eye,
trying to avoid contact with people for fear of being hounded instead of
smiling and greeting and talking with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way out of town I saw a kid with a Che Guevara t-shirt on, which
was more interesting in Cambodia since he was a communist who murdered
hundreds of innocent people senselessly, just like the Khmer Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way out of down town I set my iPhones cellular network to the one
correlating to the SIM card I had and it soon began working. I had a
phone for the first time since leaving SF almost 4 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed many large hotels, bigger hotels than any downtown, five star
resort style hotels. I felt like I was driving through Aspen until I saw
a guy on a scooter with about 20 dead chickens hanging by their legs. I
then saw a Nikon D200 advertisement and wondered if it had really been
there for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived just after noon which gave me slightly less than the
suggestion of checking in two hours before departure. That was ok though
because checking in at the airport, passing through security and passing
through Cambodian passport control was easy. There were few people
there, it was a tiny airport with only 4 gates and only one was in
service. There were 3 flights scheduled within the hour. Prices were
astronomical, $3 for a small bottle of water, $3.50 for a can of soda. I
bought a bottle of Japanese &amp;quot;wine&amp;quot; and found out it was 20% alcoholic
soju after I poured a glass. I didn't bother finishing the bottle since
it tasted like vodka and I had no intention of getting wasted. Plus
there were ants crawling on the marble bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use my international minutes while I still had the chance
and called My, my friend in Bangkok, and told her I was pretty much on
my way there. It was short notice, way shorter than I'd planned on
giving her, but it was notice all the same and if she couldn't pick me
up I was planning on finding my own way. Luckily she had nothing going
on and said she'd see me soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3662300361/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Do not wash in the urinals" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3662300361_9cd75f0289_m.jpg" style="width: 227px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I walked around a bit and looked at the
airport. It was a nice building with decent tropical landscaping
outside. It felt like the kind of airport you'd see in a tropical
resort, and then I remembered that's pretty much what it was. I saw a
sign in the bathroom instructing men not to wash in the urinals. (Note:
I'm an idiot, that sign is about trash, not washing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked around the shops in the airport and was happy that I could
actually look people in the eyes without the fear of them aggressively
hawking their goods. It was nice. I was tired of having to pass through
a crowd as if I saw nobody, it felt alienating and I was the alienator.
I took some photos of the airport and as I passed the bar the bartenders
teased me about being drunk, but I wasn't since I hadn't finished even
half of the bottle. It was funny and we laughed about it. I played
around with the networks and stuff on my phone, trying to figure out the
details of this SIM swapping thing that is so different from the US. At
one point two Japanese girls came running by, quickly passed through the
gate and ran for an airplane that was out on the tarmac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I boarded the plane and the flight attendant gave the usual speech about
disabling communications devices and I thought about that annoying sound
that the iPhone puts into some speaker systems. There was no safety demo
and we were quickly in the air. I was sitting underneath the wing with a
prop engine outside my window. We had a meal and I ate my first muffin
since leaving SF where muffins with coffee were a pretty usual breakfast.
I had coffee with my meal and it was the worst coffee I've had in years.
It reminded me of the hot black tar we'd drink at Actiontec while working
80 hour weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we flew I looked out at the beautiful clouds and remembered my flight
from Hanoi. I looked down at the earth and thought about all of the
beautiful places that were hidden in those green polygons. I saw the
reflection of the sun passing from rice paddy to rice paddy and then the
earth disappeared behind a turbulent cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our descent I noticed that the land surrounding Bangkok was back to
the familiar Vietnamese landscape of rice paddies for miles. The next
thing I noticed was that people were driving on the left side of the
road. I only had time to listen to two orbital songs before I had been
told to take my headphones off for landing. The entire flight was less
than an hour and at 2:50 I was in Thailand. The new airport in Bangkok
is eye catching and modern. Entering the country was very easy and no
visa was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After passing through passport control I went and found a new SIM card
with a phone number that people could call me on. In Thailand, inbound
minutes are free. With Skype, you can redirect inbound calls to a phone
number in any country that they support. I have a California Skype
number. I also have an unlimited world calling plan. Those three things
together allow people to call my Skype number in California and ring my
cell phone in Thailand without incurring any additional fees for
international calling. My SIM card also provided data access, which is
actually a little irritating since any network activity on my phone will
drain my phone balance, and iPhone OS 3 has no feature to disable only
cellular data. I had a working phone though, and I was again thankful
that the iPhone cracking team got the 3.0 unlock out just in time for my
arrival in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called My on the phone and told her that I was several hours earlier
than I had expected and she said she'd be at the airport in 15 minutes.
In the time between I walked around and took in the crowd. There were
many beautiful girls, many fashionable people, many people who looked
like transvestites, and many girls who looked manly kinda scary and made
me wonder about this sex change capital of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My was there in the 15 minutes she said. I passed right by her as I was
walking out of the airport, then we both turned around and caught each
other taking second looks. Her father whisked us away in a luxury Toyota
sedan. I hadn't been in a car that wasn't a Saigon taxi in a long time.
The highway system was very modern, the airport surroundings were very
modern, the landscape was clean. This was very first world and it was
odd. There wasn't a single scooter around, which made sense since we
were going over 120km/h. When we got off the highway though things
started to look more familiar. I saw some bicycles and scooters and
cement apartment buildings that weren't painted and it felt like the SE
Asia I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My's family's place was more modern though, more like what I'd expect to
find in Korea given the Korean movies I've seen. It was a three story
building with air conditioning, several laptops set around on desks,
wifi, and a Wii. There was a book called &amp;quot;Engineering Mechanics Dynamics
11th Edition&amp;quot; that was full of complex mathematical algorithms with
diagrams applying the principles to real world things like cranes and
roller coasters. There was a piece of paper inside with a hand sketched
on it and delicate decorations around the word &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; and I could tell
what My's classes for her automotive design major were probably like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played on her hacked Wii for a bit, did a round of golf and a round
of bowling and played Wario something else that was really crazy, then
she, her father Max and her sister Mint went to dinner. I hadn't had a
Thai meal in about a month. I quit eating Asian food a week before
leaving San Francisco in order to get my fill of American foods so that
I wouldn't crave them, but I love Thai food and had been anticipating
eating here. It was delicious. I got a desert and it was also delicious.
It was heavenly. I can't wait to eat again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about school and America mostly. Mint is My's younger sister
and she will be going to the USA in a few years for a foreign exchange
program. This is the same program that introduced My to Alaska and my
aunt Wendy, which is how I met her. My said that she travels 2 hours one
way to get to school, which I think is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we walked around a little sidewalk market and then went
home to do what any wired, high tech group of people does; we geeked
out. They have a room that they keep air conditioned where most
everything happens. There's a TV, refrigerator, a few computers, cups, a
sound system, a few couches, a few guitars, a bunch of desk toys, etc..
Basically a really playfully packed office living room kitchen. The cool
room reminded me of my grandmother's sitting room in Texas where she
would sit and cross-stitch while watching the discovery channel or the
movie channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend George helped me test out the inbound calling setup that I had
rigged with Skype and it worked great. We talked for about 30 minutes
about life and what we've both been up to and it was good to catch up
with an old friend one-on-one, essentially off the grid. It was also
great to have at least the inbound function of my phone working again.
It is also good to be in Thailand. I wasn't really sure what to expect
since I'd heard so much about it and it has so many different
reputations. I'm still not entirely sure what to expect, or even what
I'll do tomorrow since My is going to be busy all day, but I'm sure I'll
figure something out. There are certainly more options here than in Siem
Reap.&lt;/p&gt;

to square away his plans to go to Phuket. While I was waiting outside
for him I saw a motorcycle with a food stand sidecar drive by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went and got dinner at some dead lounge nearby. It was pretty cool
and would've been popular if it wasn't in a dead part of town. Taka was
telling me about his couch surfing experiences. One of his hosts failed
to mention that he was a nudist, was bisexual and had 3 gay room mates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go see the temples again the next day, not bothering with
sunrise, and would head straight to the last place we'd gone and didn't
have time to explore, Preah Kahn. There was a little market area across
the street from the gate so we decided to have breakfast and coffee. We
sat there by the temple entry and talked about airport security and
motorcycles. Because it was so early the vendors weren't in full force
yet so we actually managed to have an uninterrupted conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preah Kahn ended up being my favorite of the temples we saw. Much of it
was in ruins with huge stone blocks toppled over like toys and covered
with moss. It was moderately overgrown and mostly looked untouched,
though I'm sure they worked to make it look that way because I saw some
workers around the outskirts doing work on the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a few more temples that we didn't have time to see the previous
day, then headed off to a more remote location that was 14km away, the
Roluos group. This ended up being mostly disappointing though there was
one that was good, Bakong, and since it was remote almost nobody was
there. It was beautiful and was almost worth the drive, but our tuk tuk
driver told us that he couldn't take us to the other temples down there
because of bad roads or because there was nothing to see or whatever. It
was hot and we got lost looking for a temple and ended up just going
home in the early afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to my hotel, the Naga Guesthouse, I checked out because
it was the third day that the internet would be fixed the following day.
I went and checked into The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shadowofangkor.com/"&gt;Shadow of Angkor
II&lt;/a&gt;, which is a new hotel a block
away from the river in an also not busy part of town. It's brand new
though and it's really nice, probably the nicest quality hotel I've
stayed in so far. Smooth wooden bannisters, some electric water heater
with a super duper massaging shower head in a circular shower, and
broken wifi. They said it would be fixed the next day. It was only
partly broken though, and after hacking around on their network and
unplugging the power on one of their APs I managed to get weak wifi in
my room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a nap and then did some internet stuff and then Taka and I went
to get dinner. Taka got us slightly lost but only by a few blocks and we
ended up where we had intended to go, Pub Street. It was loud and busy
with bars and restaurants and people filling the street and local girls
dressed up too nice walking around alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing looked like our fancy but we found a place that served a variety
of ethnic foods and sat down. I decided to get pasta since I was a
little tired of always eating Asian food, as good as it is. As I was
reading the menu I saw the following entry: &amp;quot;Macaroni with harm and
rice.&amp;quot; This reminded me of some engrish I'd seen at lunch: &amp;quot;all the food
serve with rice. the foods not use msg.&amp;quot; Engrish is cute in an endearing
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we felt like having a few drinks, it was Taka's last night
in town after all, so we went down to some bar that was pretty cool and
not too loud that was playing American music and had a witty menu that
sounded like it was written by somebody from San Francisco. While we
were there the power to the entire place went out, but a man with a
flashlight quickly found the breaker and turned it all back on. Nobody
seemed to care, I guess that kind of thing is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taka and I headed back to the hotel and caught up on some more online
stuff and then parted ways as he went to his room to get some sleep
before waking up early to head to the airport and off to Phuket. I had
decided to stay here in town for another day or so, then head to
Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

afterwards we pulled off for a rest. Some kids were playing in the warm
rain that was dripping off the roof, running back and forth under it.
Some of us ate little meat filled buns. Taka ate some scorpions and
grasshoppers. I told him I fully intended to try them, just not in the
middle of a bus trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while later I decided to take a photograph so I could see where
we were by looking at the GPS data, but after I took the photo the GPS
info was missing from the file. Further investigation revealed faulting
wiring in the proprietary connector on my Geomet'r. So there I was on my
way to one of the largest most beautiful man made sights in the world
and my GPS wasn't working. &amp;quot;Wonderful...&amp;quot; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Siem Reap in the dark about an hour or so after I had
expected to be there. It was muddy when we got out because it had been
raining, and it was nearly pitch black because wherever we were dropped
off had like one light. So, in that darkness Taka and I negotiated with
a tuk tuk driver to take us to one of the hotels we'd found in the buide
book. He wanted to take us somewhere else but we made him take us to
where we wanted to go. I'm not so sure this was the best idea because
after I'd checked into the hotel I realized that their free internet was
not working. Internet was pretty much the only thing I had wanted from a
room. They said it might be working the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taka and I agreed to meet at the gate of the hotel the following morning
at 5am, and so we did. When I went to gate it was locked with me on the
inside. One of the employees of the hotel happened to be sleeping under
a mosquito net on the front porch and he opened the gate for me. Taka
wasn't there yet, but the employee went and woke him up for me. We
negotiated a day trip around Angkor with a tuk tuk driver, $10 for the
day, and headed out to see the sun rise at Angkor Wat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Angkor Wat is only one temple among many many temples
that are in the same locale, and as glorious as it is, it may not be the
most beautiful and is probably not the most enchanting of the temples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3654055090/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Angkor Wat lawn" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2460/3654055090_3399c61202_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Angkor Wat was larger than I thought. I thought we
were driving around a lake, but this lake ended up being merely the moat
that surrounded the temple grounds. The driver dropped us off at one of
the only two places where you can pass over the moat. There were two
monkeys sitting at the waters edge preening each other. These were the
first monkeys I'd seen on my trip. They were extremely cute and adorable
and human like. I took a few photos of them, which seemed silly when
there was the glorious sunrise behind the glorious temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angkor Wat ended up being very large. I think that is really the appeal
of it... it's like many of the smaller temples, just enlarged. It's not
more complex, it's not more beautiful, it's simply on a larger scale.
It's really awesome, and it's in better shape than a lot of the other
temples too. The problem for us was that there was scaffolding on two of
the towers and it didn't look good. Throughout the rest of the day we
would end up seeing tons of scaffolding, some cranes, tarps, and all
sorts of other temple reconstructive devices. The trick was to get as
few tourists and as little construction equipment as possible in a
photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way out we were talking about breakfast just about the time we
came upon some stalls. We were introduced to the familiar chants of
persona that could easily be programmed as bots in an Angkor simulation.
&amp;quot;Three bracelets, one dollar! You buy!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You want cold drink? I have
cold drink for you! Water for one dollar! You want beer?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You want
buy shirt? I have many colors! You buy table cloth! You give to your
girlfriend or mother! Just one dollar!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went outside the moat and found cheaper breakfast with some nice
folks. Sweet milk coffee, eggs with vegetables and bread. Yummy. A good
breakfast for what would be a long day of climbing steps and exploring
temples in the hot humidity and sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were leaving there was this little girl following us trying to
sell us bracelets, five for one dollar. She was adorable. She was 10.
She kept putting on this sad face, but I'd smile at her and she'd smile,
look away and try to put her sad face back on. I didn't buy anything
from her, but I took her photo and gave her 100r which she took very
reluctantly. She was the first of many adorable children I encountered
throughout the day who would try to pity me into buying shit that I
didn't need or want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got back to the tuk tuk my glasses fell apart. It just wasn't my
day. My GPS broke, my hotel internet broke, and here was the right-hand
lens of my glasses falling out because a tiny screw had come undone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never fear, our handy tuk tuk driver pulled out a crescent wrench, a
pair of pliers and a nail and used the pliers to hammer the nail onto
the crescent wrench like a blacksmith-to-go. Within 2 minutes I had a
makeshift micro-screwdriver to use to screw my glasses back together.
What a life saver he was. I ended up tipping him $2 at the end of the
day partly because of this and partly because he took us to some awesome
sights that we didn't ask to go to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3654055086/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Setting up a shot" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3649/3654055086_5e06881d9a_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We went on to see so many sites that I can't even
describe them all unless I do so with globals like &amp;quot;they were made
mostly of stone, they were falling apart, they were being restored, and
they were pretty ƒ amazing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each stop, before the tuk tuk had even slowed down, people would
begin shouting at you about water, shirts, flutes, postcards, scarves,
table clothes, bananas, beer, and honestly just a few other things. It
seemed like everybody was selling the same exact crap. Taka and I
suspected that the whole show was run by one organization who only
allowed these people to sell certain things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one stop there was a particularly beautiful girl trying to sell us
water, which we did need, and numerous other things that we did not,
including shirts. Taka decided to try to bargain with her by trading his
shirt for the one she was selling. She said she didn't want his shirt
because it smelled bad, and when I teased her about insulting my friend
she gave this beautiful smile and said &amp;quot;oh my gaaaaaad!&amp;quot; We teased her
some more about various things and it was nice to have some genuine
interaction with these people beyond bartering for novelties. I did end
up coming back to her to buy a soda and some water. Smiles and sincerity
go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We climbed up a steep temple and when we got to the top Taka started
chatting up the backpacker girls like he likes to do, which is actually
very useful because you end up seeing the same people over and over and
you get to share info and stories and make a lot of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took some photos and found some Cambodian guy who started telling me
all sorts of information about the place we were at. It ahd been struck
by lightning and so it was never finished, hence no carving sin the
stones. It was made from rocks brought in from Thailand on elephants and
bamboo poles, hence the round holes in all of the stones. He showed me a
mountain range in the distance that was the border to Thailand. He
showed me how to climb up onto the roof of the temple, which was
illegal, but he said you could see the tops of three of the Angkor Wat
towers over the forest from up there. He showed us the library and the
gallery, both of which were in ruins. He showed us very quick ways to
descend incredibly steep stairwells that were more like stone ladders.
He showed us some great spots to take photos. He said he'd been living
in the area for 15 years and was a high school student. He spoke very
good English and was really helpful so I tipped him $1 after he showed
us the way back to the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of the really notable places we went was the &amp;quot;tomb raider
temple&amp;quot;, which is where Tomb Raider was filmed. It was really, really
cool. There were trees that had been growing for hundreds of years that
had destroyed much of the place in an really beautiful way. It was so
beautiful that there were about 50 people walking around and you could
barely get a photo without half a dozen people in it. It was definitely
one of the coolest spots we saw today and we intend to go back tomorrow
morning before the crowds are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were in the tomb raider temple we found a group of three girls
from Steamboat Springs who had rented bikes. They were cool and we
talked with them for a while. It was nice to run into people from a tiny
place near where I had once lived. We walked with them a while but split
ways when they had to go back for their bikes. Every time I say goodbye
to somebody I meet I wonder if I'll see them again down the road. So
many of the travelers I've talked to so far say they keep bumping into
people in various cities and countries that they met previously on their
travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to get some food and found a nice spot with a few women managing
an empty shop. We got coffee and ramen and ate some really really spicy
peppers. They had a really strange bird that sounded like a trained
parrot with its vocal sounds and very beautiful calls, but was black and
yellow with some weird flaps on the back of its neck. It didn't like me
and tried to attack me, but I loved it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the girls was turning this wheel that was attached to a glass
cylinder with a golden liquid in it, which I thought was juice or beer.
She was filling 1 liter bottles with the liquid, then she'd turn the
wheel and fill the glass cylinder again. I nearly ordered one just to
try it. Taka asked her what it was and she said it was gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point in the afternoon we were walking around a mostly flat
temple with hallways and small courtyards. It began to thunder, then it
began to rain lightly, then it began to rain heavily. We happened to
step into a pile of ants and were being bitten by the ants as we ran to
take cover in one of the hallways of the temple. We were trapped by the
rain with a couple from the Czeck Republic, so we found a dry spot for
us all to sit and we talked a while about their trip to Phnom Penh and
back to Thailand. When it cleared up they headed out ahead of Taka and
I, who were both taking photos like mad. The rain had increased the
contrast of the stones and the saturation of all of the colors and the
grass in the courtyards was more beautiful than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3654055098/"&gt;&lt;img alt="From the top of the temple" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/3654055098_458da11698_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The threat of rain lingered as we saw a few
more temples, and then as we were on top of a very tall one it began to
actually rain some more. This made the stones slippery so we took
shelter and had some beer at a local shop. There were several women and
children around trying to sell us flutes and shirts and things. Taka and
I talked for a while and one 10 year old girl kept showing me these
horribly photoshopped postcards of Cambodian life. I had discovered
earlier that if you start asking questions they quit trying to sell you
things, so I asked her the normal things and then began teaching her
english words for things found in the photos on the postcards. It seemed
like out of nowhere, all the sudden I had like 6 girls trying to get me
to buy them stuff. One woman was saying she wanted me to buy here a
beer, a deaf kid a coke, and a flute for myself for $4. I agreed to do
it for $3 and we all had a good time making jokes and sparring in this
sell/buy situation. Taka had bought a mouth harp and was trying to talk
to them through it while he tried to make noise on it. I was trying to
get a girl who was trying to sell me a mouth harp to twang it while I
played the flute while blowing out of my nose. The deaf kid was just
laughing at everything and enjoying his coke, and the young girls were
were just frustrated that we wouldn't give them a dollar for little
bamboo stars and flowers and crummy post cards. It was a really fun time
and we took some funny photos, ate some bananas and then headed out into
the rain. It was nice to have some fun with the locals... I find them
incredibly frustrating when they're selling me things, but when we drop
that whole thing and let me buy what I feel like buying and just have
fun everything is a lot more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was getting late and the gates were closing soon so we had our tuk
tuk driver take us to the last big temple. This last temple ended up
being one of the coolest temples we'd seen, but we didn't have time to
explore it. It was really really large, it was raining and it was late.
Taka and I went in a ways expecting it to be small, but after finding
several large intersections of hallways into really cool looking places
we decided to give up and go home, then come back tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left that temple in the pouring rain walking on stones, in puddles
and in the mud, all underneath the trees that reached out to each other
above. The whole scene was really beautiful, the kind of thing from a
great movie, and it was a really great way to finish the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained all the way back to the hotel. When we got there I asked about
the internet and they said that it was broken. They said it might be
working the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was too late to check out, so I went to my room and took a much
needed shower and washed my clothes in the sink and hung them to dry on
whatever I could find to hang them on. I need to get a clothes line type
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a nap, but it began raining really heavy and I
couldn't sleep so I wrote this instead, and if only I had internet I
could post it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

breakfast and photographing the graffiti that had been done by
Londoners. I found the bookstore and it was closed but a man told me it
opened at 9:30. When I was on my way back I met an Australian I'd spoken
with the night before and asked him about where to go. As we were
discussing S21 and the killing fields my Japanese friend Taka came
walking up and asked me if I'd like to go with him to see one of those
places, then head to Siem Reap. We had the same itinerary and so we went
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S21 is a school that had been converted into a prison camp. It's the
most mindless thing I've ever seen in person. Education is important if
for nothing else than to teach people that it is not ever OK to
imprison, torture and kill people, especially in large numbers. The
details were different but the story was the same as the Nazis or any
number of other historical genocidal world powers. There were school
rooms that had been sectioned off into tiny cells for prisoners. There
were dozens of school rooms that had been used as torture chambers.
There were arm locks for use with extremity torture, electric shock
machines, drowning tubs and waterboards. It was really mindblowing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't have time or will to see the killing fields so we went to a
restaurant near the bus station and had pizza and beer. It was good to
have a good American meal. Taka and I talked about America and work,
he's also in IT. I remembered a lot of the BS I'd left behind like the
messed up economy, the war, the politics, employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bus to Siem Reap I thought about being unemployed and how I had
used my job as a source of identity, and how now I was searching for
something to replace that role, or to find how to get by without it. I'm
still on that bus and I've got a few more hours to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was traveling on a Mailinh tour bus and had taken a Mailinh taxi the
day before and had gotten a good price. At the front of the bus which
was at first playing an episode of a Vietnamese variety show but then
began playing popular internet videos. This was interesting because once
again there was this mix of cultures. There were videos where white men
were driving luxury sports cars that I'd seen a thousand times in San
Jose but hadn't seen once in Vietnam. There were several videos with
overt sexuality that I hadn't seen yet in actual Vietnamese culture.
Nobody cared about the robot dancing kid in the orange shirt but they
loved the video of the man who got attacked by the mule he was trying to
have sex with. I couldn't believe such a business from such a
conservative culture would be playing some of these videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonfunctioning GPS feature on my iPhone really began to bug me again
when we stopped for gas and I wondered where I was. I remembered that
the iPhone 3.0 firmware had finally gone public and had probably been
cracked since the hackers had been keeping up on 3.0 and I resolved to
network unlock my phone ASAP in hopes of restoring GPS functions and if
nothing else to give me a phone rather than a PDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the border we all got off the bus, picked up our luggage
and went into an air conditioned building with an x-Ray machine and a
group of 80 or more people waiting beyond it, and so we waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of white people, most Australians. A Japanese man from
Hiroshima spoke with me in English. He asked if I had a visa already and
when I said yes he said &amp;quot;fuck...&amp;quot; and it sounded good to hear familiar
English slang. He said he was unemployed and was traveling from Saigon
up to Thailand and back down to Singapore, nearly the same route I was
taking but in a mere 10 days. I told him he could probably buy a visa at
the checkpoint and he agreed and wised he'd brought more American
dollars. He was from North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one our names were called and our passports were returned
including arrival/departure cards. A man checked my passport and I went
outside, exchanged my book for my camera, gave my backpack to the
storage guys and boarded. Off we went for a mere 200 meters, then we had
to get off again. This was the real border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside a man checked my passport and directed me to a line. A sign at
the counter said they were having trouble with their computers, which
were running windows and had motorized Logitech webcams. They took my
passport and scanned it, took my photo, stamped the passport a half
dozen times and let me pass. A woman checked my passport as she talked
on her cell phone and let me pass into the health quarantine where there
was a x-Ray machine and a crowd of people. I filled out a health
declaration and they let me pass. It felt like I was on level 3 and just
needed to find the person to check my passport so I could continue, but
I guess level 3 doesn't require that so I went and got back on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed in Cambodia were numerous casinos, none of
which were open. There were no casinos in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I noticed was that they reluctant on the Thai alphabet,
which I thought would be a problem for me until I saw that everything
was translated into two to four written languages: Thai, some sort of
Chinese, Vietnamese and English, and I can read one and somewhat
pronounce another. The money is in Thai and English numerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At lunch I sat with the Japanese man, who was able to buy a visa at the
border, and talked about Phnom Penh, which was where our bus was headed,
and Angkor Wat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank an Angkor beer and thought about San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese man mentioned both lonely planet and the backpacker
subculture of travelers, which was promising, and mentioned that staying
near the lake rather than downtown was cheaper and hence attracted more
backpackers. I had the address of one guest house in my phone, but if
that didn't pan out at least I knew where to go to find English speakers
and cheap lodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared out the window and noticed that this road was not as busy as
just about any road in Vietnam that I'd been on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened a bottle of Aquatien and thought of Tien. Then I thought of
Adult Swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw ducks, hens, chickens, horses, cows and fields of grass, not rice.
I saw dogs, kids playing volleyball, children playing with sticks, a
naked child running in a dirt yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw orchards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw scooters, modern cars, a bare 4 wheeled vehicle that looked like a
stripped down truck, and many small structures like fences and ladders
made from thin, tall trees that grow naturally. The landscape here was
notably different and had been sectioned off for ranching livestock and
not just farming crops like Vietnam. The fenced off open fields looked
more familiar to me since almost all of America is fenced off in much
the same way. Not all people had fences though, some would tie their
cattle to palm trees or simply let their cattle wander into the middle
of the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture was mostly the same as Vietnam near the border but
turned mote to wooden houses on stilts farther in. Some had hammocks
strung between the stilts, most used the shade as a garage for scooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a ferry where locals were selling strange fruits that I'd
never seen that looked like a mix between a cactus and a muffin and
other strange things. People bathed in the river. Tori Amos sang &amp;quot;we may
be on this road but we're just imposters in this country&amp;quot; in my ear and
I concurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered why the vegetation seemed so different and when I checked the
location data for my last photo I found that we were at only 11° N and
still at sea level, which led me to no conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a man on a scooter with a barrel of piglets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to have photography as a purpose because I didn't feel like
being lost with no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3654055078/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Graffiti in Phnom Penh" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3343/3654055078_bdac4ba7df_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Phnom penh was different. There were expensive
cars, gas stations like suburban America, and the first real graffiti
I've seen in Asia. It wasn't done by locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Japanese friend and I shared a tuk tuk and went to a place on the
lake that he had found in the lonely planet. It was all the way at the
end of a narrow and winding alley and stood on stilts over the lake. It
was a $5 night guest house and the crummiest room I've had so far. The
room was about the quality of a summer camp dorm and there was no
internet. The drain in the sink went straight onto the floor and the
drain on the floor went straight into the lake. However, it was right on
the lake and there were other English speakers around and a cafe and bar
right there. The man who showed us in offered me drinks, cigarettes and
weed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to get a drink with my Japanese friend and ended up with my first
real dose of backpacker culture. Most people were speaking in English.
Most people had tattoos. Most people had piercing. I think I'm still the
only American because all the white people have English or Australian
accents and everybody else has dark skin. It was happy hour and beer was
$.75 a glass, whiskey was $.50 a shot. The bar tender offered us weed,
which wasn't on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sat with a couple from London who had been traveling for six months
from the opposite direction I was headed and had lots of stories,
recommendations and insight. They were smoking weed and lounging around
a couched area. I had a double whiskey and a beer while they talked
about how they didn't recommend Phuket, they did recommend tubing in
Laos and only a day in Angkor Wat, and talked about the lunar dance
parties on the beach in Ko Pha Ngan, the very conservative and honest
culture in Laos, and the interesting and religious mix of culture in
Malaysia. I wondered how Tien would like this and wished she were there
with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soaked in the knowledge, enjoyed the English conversation and then
went for one last beer which I drank on the deck by the shrinking lake
after being offered weed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3654055084/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Street to my hotel" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2473/3654055084_744a076744_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There are no mosquitoes here. It is the perfect
temperature. There are pillows and matts at the edge of the deck where
you can relax and watch the sun set at the waters edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was awesome for a while, but club dance music began playing and the
party turned up. It would've been the kind of thing I would have loved
at a different point in my life but I was now looking for something a
little quieter and more serene. I retired early and slept until 5:30 or
so, about the time the sun rises, and went for breakfast, photos and to
find a bookstore I'd seen on my way in.&lt;/p&gt;

reminiscent of that in &amp;quot;Lost in Translation&amp;quot;. The photographer was good
though, and Tien looked ƒ incredible. I felt like a doofus next to such
stunning beauty, but her sisters flattered me into a comfortable state
of mind. It was fun and some of it was silly. We went through several
outfits and lighting setups and it was interesting to see their
techniques, so different from what I do. It was surprisingly tiring
though, partly because of the waiting while Tien changed from one
stunning outfit and hairdo to another. After the shoot we went and had
lunch at the place where I got ill and got the same thing, but this time
I didn't eat the vegetables. Afterwards we wnt to look through photos of
the shoot. Nobody has taken photos of me in a long, long time. It was
odd to see myself, looking my age, balding, gaining a little weight. I
quickly got over my self consciousness and we picked out all the
necessary photos, paid and went not home but to a flower market. All I
wanted to do was sleep at this point, but thu bought like 10 pounds of
flowers and I carried them in my arms as we scooted home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep at last... Tien and I talked and I drifted off into a Lon nap.
When I woke up we discussed the details of my third attempt to get to
Cambodia. We would go to saigon by bus early the next morning, leaving
from Long Xuyen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 3:30. I thought about how many times I've gotten up at odd
hours of the night on this trip. Tiens brother went to find somebody to
take us to the station but didn't come back in time and we ended up
motorbiking down with her dad and sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was completely dark, it was warm and there was a crescent moon
shining through haze in the sky. We shared headphones and listened to
the garden state soundtrack. There weren't many people on the road, but
it seemed that when there were they'd pass us in groups and the headlamp
would shine a bright circle onto their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3653840963/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bus Station in Long Xuyen" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2453/3653840963_50df714856_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We arrived at the bus top late and had to
wait 45 minutes for the next one. Tiens dad shook my hand and smiled
big, then rode off on his motorbike. I thought about how interesting it
is to communicate things nonverbally, like saying goodbye to your future
father in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning light began to show the details of the rainclouds that had
been sneaking up on us in the dark, and as I photographed them they
retaliated with a gentle sprinkle. It was pretty dark and my f/4 was not
giving me much as far as shutter speed and I thought about how nice it
would be to have a tripod. Incidentally the guys at gorillapod.com
emailed me the other day asking to use a photo I took on their website
and offered to send me some gear. I wished that I had it with me already
and later told Tien that when I get back to Vietnam we'd have to go take
photos in the morning light if I had received a tripod yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were boarding the bus I realized that I didn't have any earplugs.
Luckily I had brought a second set of headphones so Tien and I could
both listen to music, but we couldn't share it on a single iPod. I made
a mental note to remember earplugs from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way down the bumpy and now familiar route to saigon, the
first time in dayligt. At the ferry station I watched crowds of people
passing. I saw a guy on a bicycle flirting and joking with the girl he
was with and thought about how great it is that mannerisms transcend
spoken language. These two were happy and I could see that. Some women
behind them were happy and I could see that. Another woman was in a
hurry and I could see that. When you're surrounded by people who don't
speak your language you begin paying attention to such things and they
take on a bigger weight in the absence of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a half white girl on a bicycle, easily distinguishable because of
her brown hair, and realized I had seen another in a restaurant a few
days earlier. I wondered if these were products of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw people taking a motorcycle riding class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we stopped for a break Tien and I got breakfast, eggs and bread and
coffee, which made me very happy. When a skillet was placed before me I
touched it to move it and burned my finger a little and cursed. Instead
of the American ever-liable reaction of sympathy and placation, the
employee who had set it down laughed and smiled at me and said something
in Vietnamese. I thought this was awesome. People need real world
conditioning, not the legal shelter from physical reality and
responsibility that so many liability lawsuits in America display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to Saigon the traffic was terrible. I realized that even
though Saigon is great for so many reasons I really don't like it all
that much. It's not bad to stay a day in, but I wouldn't recommend an
extended visit over Hanoi or more rural places. Then again, maybe it's
different if you speak the language, know the hidden gems, or at least
have your own transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3653840977/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hiding poorly" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3653840977_8fde293345_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tien and I checked into a mildly crummy and hence
overpriced hotel and caught up on missed sleep. We sat on the bed and
ate pringles and drank soda from the fridge and went back to bed. The
best thing about vacationing is a lack of responsibility. We were free
to do whatever we wanted with our time and chose to be lazy. Eventually
we got up and had lunch, discussing some details of her immigration,
then realized we wouldn't see each other for a few weeks and had a sad
goodbye. I gave her a few billion dong, the Vietnamese currency, put her
in a taxi and was alone again in Saigon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the night in my hotel room catching up on computer
stuff and being lazy some more. In the morning I shaved my head, checked
the charge on my gadgets, checked out of my hotel and headed for an
Australian cafe I'd seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Australian cafes are not the same as American cafes, which I
stupidly expected because of the shared language. I did have a cappucino
though, my first in weeks, and a Vietnamese breakfast of bread and beef
stew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Filipino man was sitting at the next table and began talking to me. He
asked about my travels and my work and said he was looking for a cheaper
hotel. It was nice to have a conversation and I hoped to find more
English speakers on my journey through more popular tourist
destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wnt to the bus HQ and checked in for my ride. I was required to hand
over my passport and was told it would be given back at the border of
Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we boarded the bus I was asked to let them pack my backpack. When I
asked to take it on the bus they said no, so I took my book and gave it
up. This was the first time letting it out of my control while
traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got on the bus, found a seat centered between the axels and read until
we began to drive away. We passed the bus station where I proposed to
Tien as we crawled a crooked trail out of the city. I wished that I had
my bag, or more accurately my camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've wished several times on this trip that I had just brought along a
panasonic LX3. I've even considered buying one and mailing my D300 back
to America, but have not. Maybe I'll buy a messenger bag instead,
something easy to carry a few accessories in. A man purse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am on the bus to Cambodia, writing again on my iPhone. I
really wish the iPhone had real GPS support. I thought that it did, and
the accuracy of the 3g iPhone made it seem so, but I have not been able
to get a GPS signal on it since leaving SF even though my Geomet'r works
fine. It sucks because it's not like I knew that before I left, it's not
something I could've tested. Maybe if I put in a local SIM card it'll
work...&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't intend to get one for her, even if Vietnamese girls don't
traditionally get them. I wanted to get something for her before I
headed off to travel so she'd have something to remind her that Id' be
coming back for her soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday night she, two of her sisters and I went down to Long Xuyen to go
jewelry shopping. We found a nice shop and I told her to pick out
whatever she wanted. The styles were a little gaudy, not delicate, and
neither of us immediately saw anything we liked but we managed to find
something that suited her. She also picked out some earrings and we were
both happy about it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, the words million and billion are only one letter different.
In America only the filthy rich have a problem with those kinds of
monetary figures. Out here in four-leading-zeros land we do have those
kinds of problems from time to time.  When it came time to pay, she
thought I was joking when I said I didn't have that kind of money on me,
even though I'd just gone to the ATM.  I thought she was upset when she
said &amp;quot;fine, we'll just go home.&amp;quot;  In reality she was joking and I had
misheard the price as being in billions, not millions, 1000 times more
than it actually was.  This is still a source for a good laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out to eat afterwards and had some kind of omelet that you'd
wrap inside leaves. It was really good, perhaps better than simply
having an omelet. During dinner a man rode a scooter through the
restaurant and nobody cared.  Lizards crawled on the walls.  The owner
asked about my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_patch"&gt;soul patch&lt;/a&gt;
and said I was too young to have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3634286327/"&gt;&lt;img alt="My Wonderful Fiancé" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3662/3634286327_19e1ea7740_m.jpg" style="width: 173px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On Tuesday Tien and I went out for breakfast. We
found a restaurant with tables under grass huts with puppies and
chickens running around. She picked out some new foods for me to try,
including some weird seafood that I amazingly did not completely
dislike. It began pouring rain during breakfast, and our grass hut did a
good job of keeping the rain off of us as we laughed at the chickens
running around looking for shelter away from the humans. We ordered some
more food to wait the rain out with. Then it didn't stop so we just
motorbiked home in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Later I began feeling ill and attributed it to dinner the previous
night. My doctor had warned me not to eat raw vegetables because they
had probably been washed in water that had bacteria that my body was
not used to. I guess she was right. It began raining and didn't stop
for hours. We tried to find ways to enjoy ourselves indoors, and I
ended up finding some string and teaching her nieces how to make knots
that come undone by pulling on them and other silly things.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It was a lazy day. Tien and I talked about visa and passport plans and
did research about how all of that stuff works.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of the lulls in the rain I heard car horns from the street
and dogs barking. I thought about how there might be feral dogs out
running in the road, and it occurred to me that I haven't seen any
roadkill here. I suspect that because of traffic dynamics the average
Vietnamese driver is more alert than the average American driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would go to Cambodia the next morning. The bus left
really early though and the stop for it was about 2 hours away on
motorbike. Her family had been trying to coerce me into staying, they
love me and were pointing out that I had some wet clothes and was a
little bit ill, but I had places to go and I didn't have much to do in
Binh Hoa. I was worried that it would rain though, so I told Tien that
if it was raining in the morning I wouldn't go yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed up a bit later chatting and preparing for my trip. I was eying
one of the books that I helped Tien pick out for her English student:
New Era English Conversation for Absolute Beginners. Most of this book
is very, very useful, but I happened to open it to probably the least
useful but most comical page. In chapter 5 the following phrases were
used as conversational examples for describing things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;His long mustache framed the side of his lips like fire from the
window of a burning house.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The expensive cut of his suit and the quite dignity of his
expression belied the single bullet hole in the left side of his
head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning Tien's alarm didn't go off when we thought it would.
We were up an hour late, and although we probably could've made it in
time if we went really quickly I didn't want to do this because
motorbiking on wet streets and wet dirt paths is not a good idea,
especially with Tien having to steer with the heavy load of me and my
backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to Cambodia I spent most of the day sleeping. It felt
like my body was fighting something off, so it may have been better that
I didn't go to Cambodia yet. I also got in touch with my friend Scott
from San Jose who has a cousin in Saigon who works at a travel agency.
Small world. I'll probably end up going through them to get to Angkor
Wat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wasn't sleeping Tien and I were doing more research on her visa
situation. We called the US Embassy at three different numbers and sent
a few e-mails to which we got one reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we went out to Long Xuyen to look for portrait studios and
so Tien could go to school. On the way in it rained on us. It was warm
though and actually felt kinda nice. When it stopped raining the air was
dry and warm and it was fully night. Tien went to school and I went with
her sisters to get some dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than simple containers with no moving parts, I don't think I've
seen a single toothpick holder in Vietnam that isn't broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner I headed out with Thu and Mai to hit up the wedding
portrait studios. We went to a large shop on the corner of a main
street. There were large books with photos of couples in many different
scenes with romantic phrases written in engrish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lizard crawled across the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lizard crawled across the face of a beautiful girl in a photograph on
the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thu and Mai talked away in Vietnamese with several girls at the shop,
not another English speaking person in sight, and I just through the
books and critiqued the photography which was mostly very good. It was
really funny to me that I'd be taking photos like this the next day, and
I thought about traditions. I think that ceremony often puts a bad cover
on an otherwise great book. This photography thing is not the kind of
thing I would choose to do on my own, but because it's traditional and
because Tien wants to do it I'm happy to do it, even if I feel a little
silly doing so. The really good stuff comes later, and that's what I'm
looking forward to. Going to America, traveling around, discovering new
places, rediscovering old places and living out this dream.&lt;/p&gt;

after I asked her to marry me, we did what most people do during the mid
day heat and napped it away in a cool place. We talked and were happy
with all that had happened and the new direction things were going with
the two of us. We talked about traveling to America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner we found ourselves on a side-street with many english speakers
and restaurants that had Asian and western cuisine. We shared a ham and
cheese crepe along with a VN dish, and I had a Saigon Red. It was very
satisfying to taste a bit of home and to drink that cold beer on that
hot day with my new fiancé. I thought about asking the other English
speakers about traveling to Cambodia, but decided not to since my plans
were not set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back to the hotel room and took a short nap, checked out of the
comfort of the hotel and instead chose to (try to) sleep on the bus on
the way to Binh Hoa where we would tell her parents about our decision.
I got just about no sleep, and was hardly comfortable until we got to
Long Xuyen where other passengers got out. This was like 2 miles from
her house. It was 1am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what all was said because Tien is the only english speaker
in her family, but later she told me that she had told them and they are
happy with our decision and give us their blessing. I wasn't sure when
she was going to tell them and having learned that they already knew I
felt a little weird being past what would've been a moment in the
spotlight for me to ask for their permission and thank them for their
blessing. I really have no idea how this works in Vietnam, and I doubt
I'd be much good at it even in American culture. I guess I'm just used
to doing things my own way so when it comes to doing things the way of
tradition I'm lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a delicious breakfast at the market and talked things over. We
decided that she would stay here to finish a class she is taking, get
her passport and her visa to come to America, and that I would continue
traveling as I had planned. This tears me a little because I had so
hoped that she would be able to come with me, but it's just not
possible. It will be good to continue to travel though, but it would be
good in a slightly different narrative as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the evening on skype and on chat with friends and family,
telling them about how our engagement came about, and everybody was very
happy and congratulated me as I knew they would. I had at one point
thought about calling a close friend to ask his advice on the situation,
but thought better of it knowing exactly what he'd say. I was right, and
it was great to have the support and excitement of my friends and
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people told me before I left to come to Asia that I was &amp;quot;living
the dream.&amp;quot; I never really thought about it like that, I just thought I
was doing what I wanted to do. Now though I am having dreams and making
them come true and so I do feel like I am doing as they said, I am
living the dream.&lt;/p&gt;

Kaskade in my ears I took my seat. I gave up the music for some more
Jack Kerouac, which I'm really enjoying. My aunt recommended &amp;quot;On the
Road&amp;quot; to me, and Rob had gotten it for me as a going away present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my VN flights there has been a view from the cockpit of the runway
displayed on all of the video displays during take off and landing. It's
pretty neat and I'd never seen that sort of thing before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered how many miles I had traveled so far. It's too bad there's
not a tool to go through my flickr page, order by date and create a
rough estimate of distance traveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controller for the entertainment system on this plane was labeled on
the back as an &amp;quot;Enhanced Passenger Control Unit.&amp;quot; I had to laugh at
that, envisioning myself being controlled through some enhanced method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading several pages, which is about how much I tend to digest of
books at a time, I put it down and turned the music back on. I had
beautiful, inspiring music in my ears and outside of my window were huge
billowing clouds, some of the most beautiful clouds I've ever seen. I
took some photos with my iPhone but they came out pretty bad. The motion
of passing them was also part of their wonder. I became really inspired
and began dreaming about the future... what I would do with my future,
where I would go. My mind kept wandering away from my trip to Cambodia
and so on, I was dreaming about a girl instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was deep in the zone. &amp;quot;The Zone&amp;quot; is one of those things you have to
experience to know exactly what it is. Some call it The Ether. I was
having great dreams of great things and a great life. There are people
that dream great things and let them go, and there are those of us who
dream great things and make them happen. I had dreamed about quitting my
job, selling my things and flying away to Asia and I made it happen. Now
I was having new great dreams and I wanted to make them happen...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I landed in Saigon, only the name of a hotel in a note on my iPhone.
Walking out to the front of the airport I thought Tien might be there
waiting for me, so I stood by the window and looked for a while. I
didn't see her, so I went outside and found a taxi driver who said he
knew where the hotel was and we headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3620695325/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Commuting family" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3598/3620695325_96c4e731e8_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Rush hour traffic was nuts, I've never seen traffic
so chaotic, so packed. People were driving their scooters on the
sidewalks through the park just to get around the gridlock. A man on a
scooter ran into the back of another scooter and knocked her over.
People were intentionally driving the wrong way down one way streets to
get closer to where they were going. We drove down tiny one lane alleys
with scooters coming at us and passing us. One of them hit the mirror of
the taxi and knocked it inwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us a long time to get a short distance, but my taxi driver was
on top of stuff and got us to the neighborhood quicker than others
would've. The problem was that when we got there he didn't know where
the hotel was. We had a minor argument in broken english and written
amounts of money and he dropped me off at the Ruby Star hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ruby Star ended up being a good choice. The staff was nice, the
woman at the counter spoke english, there was WiFi in my room, a stocked
fridge, and it was a block away from where all the backpackers were
staying. I stayed in for the night, catching up with friends and
checking e-mail, facebook and flickr. I chatted with Tien and she said
she was in fact in Saigon and had intended to meet me at the airport,
but traffic had been so bad she couldn't make it. I was happy that she
had even tried, and more so that she was there in Saigon. We agreed to
meet at my hotel the next morning at 8am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4496474116/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Taking one last call" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4052/4496474116_1f1a515071_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;She showed up right on time and we headed out
for breakfast and to see what was nearby. Breakfast was good food and
good company and good conversation. I was happy as could be to have her
back, I'd missed her a lot on my trip and was sad that she couldn't go,
especially since she'd spent so much time setting the whole thing up. I
thought about the dreams I'd had the day before and was happy. We talked
about life and traveling and I don't really remember what else...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we went and got lost in the city trying to find a book store. We
didn't really get lost in the city as much as lost from the bookstore.
People kept telling us to go different ways, and then when we found the
bookstore it was closed so we had to find a different one. We finally
found the other one and it was quite a ways away from the hotel,
especially given the late morning sunlight beating down on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book store was cool inside. We found some ESL books for her to use
in teaching her neighbor. There were a lot of books, many of them with
incorrect info about customs, typos, etc.. I found two that looked good
though, things that I'd use if I were teaching english. We looked for
another book to use that would teach small business conversation. I
picked up one that had silhouettes of business people with one man
talking on his cell phone and no words on the cover in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, when I opened it up the entire book was all about
graphic sexual things. There were diagrams of body parts and
translations for things like exhibitionism, bondage and masochist. I
flipped through it and sure enough, it was not at all about business and
entirely about sex. I thought for a minute about buying it for my
friends in San Francisco as a joke, but I thought the novelty of it was
only worthy of a story and not of the book itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vietnamese girl spoke to me in very clear English, I was impressed
with her pronunciation. Like all conversations with white people in
Vietnam, she started out by asking where I was from. Then she went on to
ask me why on earth the word &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; meant &amp;quot;really awesome.&amp;quot; Aside from
using Michael Jackson as an example, I explained to her that Americans
use a lot of negative things as slang to mean &amp;quot;really awesome.&amp;quot; Phrases
like the bomb, the shit, dope. It never occurred to me that this is how
it worked until that moment. She looked so inquisitive, like she
couldn't possibly comprehend why on earth we would do such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she asked if Tien was my friend. Tien thinks that everybody looks
at she and I because she's so short and I'm so tall next to her. I think
this is partly true, but people stare at me all the time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out and got some strawberry smoothies to cool off. Even in
mid-day heat in Saigon you can still get brain freeze from drinking a
smoothie too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/5825337712/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Left Turn" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2798/5825337712_b73899db54_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We walked and walked and walked and got sorta lost and
found our way back near the hotel. I was a little irritated with how
loud the city was, how smoggy it was, and how hot it was. Saigon is an
ubiquitously noisy city. There's nowhere you can go that isn't noisy.
This noise is created mostly by scooters, and thus there is almost
nowhere you can go where it isn't smoggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a park looking area at a central bus stop and found some shade
on a short wall under a tree for us to sit in for a while. Tien began
talking about sad things... about how she had missed me and how our
cultures were different and how we could only be friends and she was
going to have to accept that. I've regarded her as a girlfriend, so this
was disheartening, and I didn't feel like leaving it at that since I
knew she was giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her about what she would have if she could have it her way. If
things could be great, how would they be? What were here great dreams?
She didn't want to tell me, so I told her I'd tell her my great dream if
she told me hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she wanted to be a pharmacologist, which is true and is great
but wasn't related to what we were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she wanted to be with me, to travel around the world with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told her my great dream that I couldn't get off my mind. The great
dream that had been growing in me for a long time and had blossomed on
the plane from Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her to marry me and to come back to San Francisco with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told her that whenever I thought about the future of my travels I
quickly ended up on thoughts of her and I traveling and discovering
great things together. I told her that all of the great things I thought
about for the future somehow ended up with her. I told her that we had
an opportunity to have a great, amazing life together, in love, seeing
the world, enjoying each other side by side from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3622502414/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tien and I" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3622502414_637f2c5dcd_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There was some confusion and reiteration and assuring her
that I was serious and not just speaking hypothetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not traditional, it was not a Hallmark card. There in the mid-day
heat on a little wall under the shade of a tree in that crummy park at
the bus station surrounded by construction and oceans of noisy,
polluting scooters in the middle of Saigon, without a ring but without
any hesitation or doubts, with just a shared dream of being happy
together I asked Tien to marry me and she said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

had meant to develop before I laid down. Around 7am I went upstairs and
ate breakfast by myself. I peeled a banana for myself and thought about
meals with Tien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around the building tops and noticed that the clean lines of
the architecture were more prominent without fire escapes. I haven't
seen a single one since I've been here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At checkout I caught up on some internet stuff on the lobby. My brother
says he probably won't come to Bangkok, which is pretty disappointing. I
really need to find a traveling companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour split into two groups, and unbeknownst to me I would not see
many of them again. I lost the English speaking couple from Miami and my
two favorite children. I ended up with the brat, but also with the
Parisian couple. We piled into an SUV and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl on the back of a scooter with a cute backpack on her lap
and a crowbar in her left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw soldiers doing target practice with rifles on the side of a city
street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the capital campus. Here we entered an area where no cameras,
water or cell phones were allowed. No talking, no hands in pockets. Lots
of soldiers standing at attention. We were a large group of tourists
walking silently on a red path through a huge building that looked like
a CTF flag area. Instead there was the preserved body of Ho Chi Minh
himself, laying in a glass box in a dark room with 4 soldiers posted
around him. I was trying to stay close to the Parisians and for some
reason all I could think of was the word &amp;quot;morte&amp;quot; as said by the frail
man in Amelie. Morte indeed, but he looked just asleep, laying there
with even his beard still in tact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3618312274/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Presidential Palace of Vietnam" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3648/3618312274_960b020a92_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We left and the tour guide gave me my
gear back, the we went the Presidential Palace is, which is the
equivalent of the Whitehouse, and a few other places that were packed
with us lemmings. Some of the Vietnamese people looked at me as much as
the sights. There were a lot of white people and it was weird. I think I
just hate to be associated with the mainstream American ideal and all
the white people reminded me of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a place called the house on stilts that wouldve been awesome
to stay in. There were too many people so I didn't bother taking a
picture. Outside the house there were a dozen people standing around a
sign that was in French, Vietnamese and English: Do not stand here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a million other placess in Vietnam this place had a shrine. Like
other shrines and temples, outside of it were loud children and
pedalers. Vietnam is definitely a religious country and the business
minded people are monetizing that. I've never seen this in America.
Nobody set up an ice cream cart and a religious souvenir shop outside of
a cathedral in any city I've been to in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3618312266/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hats!" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3416/3618312266_4cd5154460_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We left the capital and headed to the largest market in the
city, both indoor and outdoor. I walked in and out, through streets and
up stairs and down small ailes and down stairs. I thought &amp;quot;what the hell
is there for me in a place like this?&amp;quot; Then I wondered why I had come on
this trip in the first place. Feeling the need to have a purpose I have
settled on photography as my primary purpose. Photojournalism, I guess.
So with that in mind I began taking photos and wished I had my 10-20mm
lens on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a dozen k ock-off apple products. They put the apple backwards
though. I almost decided to buy a knock-off iPhone just to see what it
was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an ATM and pulled out 2,500,000 to pay the tour guide back the
money I owed him and have some left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iistened and thought about bow much easier Vietnamese is than Chinese.
For one thing, when I ask what something is called people don't get into
an argument about exactly what it's called in whatever dialect, they
just answer. There is the intonation thing still, which makes sense
thinking back to all the VN people I worked with at Actiontec. I think
Vietnamese is much prettier when it's spoken clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was down to just me and the Parisians on the tour now. We stopped for
lunch at a restaurant where the hostesses had tropical patterned shirts
emblazoned with the names of placess not on this continent, like
Jamaica. As we had only a few words of common language between their
broken English and my broken French, we ate in silence and listened to
the swank jazz music playing in the nearly empty restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked a little towards the end. They recommended Da Lat like the
Couple from Florida had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to the airport I thought about how the scooter makes the
dynamic of the cities here so much different. I wonder what SF would be
like with thousands of electric scooters. I thought about what it would
be like to roll up to The Irish Bank and just park in the alley, and
then I realized that I hadn't seen a &amp;quot;no parking&amp;quot; sign anywhere in
Vietnam, nor parking meters, just garages an paid parking lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a banner ad for a resort and golf club and thought about how
playing golf in Vietnam is good enough for some people. I wonder what is
good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw an ad for Ford SUVs and thought &amp;quot;who the hell over here would buy
a Ford?&amp;quot; I looked at the steering wheel of the SUV I was in and found
the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At check in I said good bye to the nice Parisian couple who was
finishing off a 40 day tour. On the wall behind the check in counter
there was a stencil of Santa Clause which may have been the first
graffiti I had seen on the trip yet. There was also a man in shined
shoes, pressed slacks, a striped button down shirt and a bright green
baseball cap with the word &amp;quot;groove&amp;quot; on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a Windows XP terminal and wondered how on earth these people could
afford XP Pro, especially with Linux as an alternative. I guess it's
bundled with the PC like in the US, and that's still expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the airport I heard English announcements with English accents. I
found the business lounge that had internet and food for $10, which is
just too much so internet will have to wait. Instead I sat down and
wrote this on my iPhone then went and had my first taste of whiskey in
Vietnam and listened to Kaskade, got on my plane and flew away.&lt;/p&gt;

Hotel in Hanoi Vietnam. I was drinking a Tiger beer and had just used up
all the hot water washing away the sweat from a long day of hiking and
boating in Ha Long Bay. The photographs from the last 24 hours were
importing from my D300 into LR2 and were instantly being backed up to my
external hard disk where they would be safe in the event that my laptop
got stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel room was different from my other one which was directly across
the hall. That one had a view of the downtown park out its window. The
window here could be opened about 2 inches before it hit a hot water
pipe. I guessed I wouldn't be getting anything like the sunrise
awakening I got today on the 5th floor of the Bach Dang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3660179574/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Floating in Ha Long Bay" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2480/3660179574_05e2528dd7_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This morning when I woke up there was sand
and a bunch of rocks where there used to be water, and I remembered that
we were on the Pacific Ocean. The tide had gone out. I got ready, went
downstairs and ate my breakfast with the parisian couple, caught up on
some online stuff and then we headed off for the boat. On the way I saw
an image of a bay with a speed boat circling another boat. A minute
later I saw that same bay and the same speed boat circling two rocks
sticking up from the water where the 2nd boat had been. I wondered why
on earth in a place with such blatant and obvious beauty did somebody
feel the need to embellish with a composited image. Advertising spits in
the face of true beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were going to be outside all day long I put on a bunch of sun
screen, and I managed to find and buy a hat with the bartering help of
one of the VN mothers who is on my tour. I got a good price on it,
something like $2. This is especially nice because when I was shopping
with Tien for hats I couldn't find one that fit, and this one fits
perfectly. It is emblazoned with the Vietnamese flag and the name of the
country, my first souvenir and a functional one at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got on the boat I found the tour guide and got down to business.
I was in debt to him a healthy 5,131,000 and had to come up with the
money in the next day. I forked over 4 millions on the spot and told him
I'd get the rest to him later. I thought about &amp;quot;Coming to America.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out across the wide bay on a junker style boat, an open upper
deck and a covered gallery below, no handrails on the front end by the
stairs and one mast that is clearly not used for sails. The sky was hazy
and provided a diffused shield from the sunlight, which was very nice.
Unfortunately as soon as I noticed this it went away and we were
attacked by direct sun rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody began taking photos on the upper deck even though the cliffs
were still a few miles away. It continued, however, until the cliffs
were right there, and then it wasn't so ridiculous. The cliffs are
great... they're strange. They remind me of the cliffs by my house in
Almont, except completely overgrown and with an ocean at the bottom.
They were immediately impressive and I can see exactly why this place is
being nominated for one of the 7 natural wonders of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were little groups of boats and floating houses that were tied
together. We stopped at one that had little square openings in a
floating deck, holes where different kind of sea life were swimming
around. Crab, shrimp, all sorts of stuff I didn't recognize. There was a
man with bloody hands chopping up a fish. There was a man pouring
boiling water onto two large fish in a large pot. A man took a fish out
of the water and clubbed it three times before it quit flopping around
and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got back on the boat and kept going. Some other folks that weren't on
our tour were on the boat and one of them was a camera nut. He had an
old nikon film cam with a 28mm ƒ/3.5 lens and a modest external flash.
He was taking pictures of his family on the boat. We talked a little
about photography through the only other english speakers on the tour.
It always bugs me when people ask how much my gear cost. I always think
back to that time where these two guys were trying to hustle me in SF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3624102811/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Docked at Surprise Cave" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3403/3624102811_c065e1667e_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We slowly circled counter clockwise and
northward until we got to a place called Surprise Cave. I never found
out what the surprise was, but we sure as hell found the cafe. It was
really big, way bigger than I expected. The caverns stretched maybe 100m
or so into the rock. It looked like something out of Half-life 2 and I
kept looking around for head-crabs and corpses with spare supplies. It
was the other two english speakers and I walking around and we had lost
the tour but we quickly found them with the sonic assistance of a
wailing spoiled brat. We talked about how awful that kid was. We agreed
that he is a monster. We finished the tour of the cave and headed for
the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was incredibly hot at this point and I was pretty much showering
in my own sweat, so I bought a cold drink off a vendor and took it back
to the boat. As we pulled out of the dock we talked about weather, hot
and cold. The girl was talking about how cold NYC was on new years. I
told her that if she had the right clothes she'd be almost fine with the
cold. She said that even with the right clothes her face would still be
cold. I told her that there's no cold a bottle of whiskey can't help you
withstand. She said that she doesn't drink. She was wearing a t-shirt
that said &amp;quot;just add cocktails.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was a man-made beach. There's no natural sand in Ha Long bay
so they had to bring in sand from other places. Since the waves are so
small I imagine they don't have to refill the sand on the beach very
often. It was a nice beach and we spent an hour on the island. I climbed
up to the top of the precipice and took a bunch of photos. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3615598274/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ha Long Bay" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3609/3615598274_015b305811_n.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 213px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I was kicking myself for not bringing my tilt/shift lens with me. It was
too heavy to bring, but the views from the top of this place would've
been ƒ *amazing* in TS. I will just have to come back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream was never so good. I sat at the bottom of the cliff in the
shade of a hut and ate an ice cream cone while the sweat shower I had
taken on my way up the mountain evaporated. I looked at the ticket for
the tour and saw that it cost 40,000 dong. That's about $2.50. The
relativity of wealth is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back to shore, got on the bus and started driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl on a bicycle talking on her cell phone while the girl on
the back held a parasol above their heads. I saw this again a few hours
later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw four adults on a 110 cc scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a man on a bicycle with a stack little cages with colorful birds
inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a little girl sitting in front of her dad on the scooter, sleeping
with her head on the dials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3656404044/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Painting mugs" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2109/3656404044_0ef0e150a8_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I saw cows grazing in a cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a woman on the sidewalk cutting a block of ice with a table saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the commonality of models, the Honda Wave 110 is the most
reliable scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a little pottery place where girls were hand making and
hand painting pots. They made all sorts of clay things, from lions to
ducks to cups to chopsticks to pots to vases. They were pretty girls,
quiet and attentive to their work. It was amazing to see them so
smoothly stroke out the designs they were doing. I thought that they
could make much more money being artists in America. They asked me to
exchange $10 for them, so I gave them a good deal at 100,000 dong. They
deserved it, I wasn't going to buy any of that novelty stuff anyway,
even if it was skillfully made by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3634273683/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Outskirts of Hanoi" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3376/3634273683_4befd83293_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We continued driving. Vietnam countryside is almost
entirely rice paddies. Fields and fields of beautiful green rice with
roads running through them. The people here are real farmers. They don't
just drive farm equipment, they do the farming. They walk out in that
field and cut that rice by hand. They wrap it into a bushel by hand,
pile it into a package and wrap it by hand, then put it on a bicycle and
ride it back to town where they they do whatever it is that they do to
make it into small grains, and then they sweep it up and put it in bags.
They also burn a lot of stuff, I don't know what that's all about but
there were fires and smoke everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these fields I was reminded of the drive between Colorado and
Texas, which I've done more times than I can count. I used to hate that
drive, and I wonder how bad it would be right now because I don't get
tired of staring out the window at rice paddies, listening to music on
my iPod. I'm sure I will though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In America, homeless people gather under bridges. In Vietnam, everybody
does. A bridge provides shade from the sun, and you will see people
selling drinks, bread, pho, anything you can imagine under a bridge in
the middle of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a circle of houses around a large depression, a hole in the earth
that had a pond in the bottom of it. I wondered if it was a bomb crater
from the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for dinner and even though it was nearly sunset, it was
blazing hot. So hot that as soon as somebody put ice in my glass it
immediately started spinning around as it melted. It was gone before I
had finished my first glass of tea. My second glass was warm. The meal
was good though. I don't know why they have to serve fish with the head
still attached. Everything I chose to ate was good, right up until the
end. There was a soup which I later found out was spinach and crab meat
soup, but when I tasted it I could've sworn it was dirt soup. It was
absolutely terrible. It literally tasted like eating dirt, and I do know
this from experience because one time when I was running from the police
I tripped on a fence and ate a mouthful of dirt, then just lay there
still in the field hoping they wouldn't see me, so I got a good long
taste of dirt. This soup tasted exactly like that, except it was liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I excused myself and went outside to play with the nicer kids. I had
brought my hacky sack and tried to teach them to play. The boy picked it
up quickly, but the girl fell into the problem of trying to kick too
high. I couldn't get her to kick low, and her brother kept treating it
like it was a full contact sport so she soon left. The father of the
brat came over and he, another guy and I had a good game and all ended
up once again showered in sweat. We piled back into the van and headed
back to Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there are so many scooters in Vietnam there are also a lot of
helmets. People express theirself through their choice of helmet. Some
helmets look like baseball caps. Some look like cowboy hats. Some look
like military hats. Some look like girly sun hats. They have some pretty
rad helmets here. I'm pretty sure they're not DOT approved though so I'm
not going to bother buying one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made it back to the hotel and I made it to my room, which brings us
to now. I'm sitting on the floor, a single protected wifi signal within
sight, a little bit of beer left in the can, wondering once again if I
should go out and make the best of Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same problem I've run into in America. Do you leave your
comfy bubble where you can simply be lazy and go out into the big bad
world and experience something exciting, or do you stay indoors where
you're safe and cozy? Tonight, I'm not sure... I may stay in and develop
the 300 or so photos I took today. Bleh, never enough time, even on
vacation, if that's what this is.&lt;/p&gt;

room on the 5th floor looking out over Ha Long Bay and the bridge, and
watching the moon rise above the hills on the opposing shore. I'm just
one girl and a bottle of wine short of the most romantic night ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning we departed for Ha Long bay and I finally realized that
when our tour guide says 8am he means wheels rolling at 8am. I always
seem to be the last one on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out through early Hanoi traffic which seemed to flow mostly
into the city instead of out, so it wasn't busy. We stopped for tea a
long while into the drive and I was delighted to find a lot of art at
this shop. There were paintings, mosaics, and sewn images showing
traditional Vietnamese scenes, and surprisingly some showing nude female
figures. Sexuality and nudity have so far been almost completely absent
except mildly in advertisements for mobile phones and karaoke bars.
There were a group of kids sewing images by hand into canvases, a lot
like cross stitching, and it was nice to see art being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for lunch at a temple that had a gondola to take us to the
top of a mountain, except the gondola wasn't running. This was pretty
disappointing to many of us. Apparently the lore says that some king
left his country behind to come seek enlightenment, then his people
followed him and begged him to come back so he did for a while and then
left again. He built the temple at the top of the mountain. In modern
times the communist Vietnamese government owns both of the temples and
doesn't use them for religious purposes at all but rather just to make
money off of tourists like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got back in the car and I adored my iPod as a savior from the wailing
screams of this bratty little kid that's on the tour. He hits and kicks
his parents and screams at the top of his lungs when he doesn't get his
way. I'm amazed that his mother lets him get away with it because she
seems like a strict type, but then I think he sees through her bluffing
threats of discipline. He's a fucking brat though, that's for sure, so
the music went up nice and loud. Rock and roll in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at another temple, this one used for actual religious
purposes, and I walked around taking photos of the scenes. I was mildly
scolded by a monk for setting foot inside a holy place without taking my
sandals off. I photographed 3 monks talking to a girl with a motorcycle
helmet on. I heard sounds of welding coming from below a secluded corner
of a courtyard and couldn't help thinking that I was supposed to jump
off the wall and pick the lock on the gate below, fight the fake monks
and find the secret passage down to the nanotech laboratory where evil
was being done behind a facade of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549978/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Little Monks" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3609/3610549978_c39e059a2c_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 169px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I thought twice about that and instead went off to play
with some monk kids who surrounded me laughing and saying short english
phrases, playing with my arm hair, wrapping their hands around my arms
to see how big they were, and patting my fat belly. One of the monks
talked in english with me briefly and brought me a book on Buddhism, and
then I had to go so the whole group shouted &amp;quot;see you again!&amp;quot; as I ran
down the steps of the temple towards the bus, last one in again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549970/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bridge over Ha Long Bay" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2435/3610549970_5bba0d1cec_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We drove and drove and drove and I listened to
louder rock music. Finally we arrived in Ha Long bay opposite its
glorious side. We checked into the hotel and I stupidly tried to go make
the best of the day. I say stupidly because I was soon drenched in sweat
and nearly cheated out of money to use an elevator that goes up to this
really beautiful bridge, and later found out that you're not really
supposed to go out during the day. Apparently everybody here naps during
the day so they can stay up at night when it's cooler, which makes so
much sense I never thought an entire society would come to that
conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After showering my sweat away I got a beer and sat in the restaurant
mooching wifi. Other than the wifi and chatting with my brother about
his meeting me in Thailand on the 26th this was a miserable experience.
The beer was warm and the room was hot. I didn't even think to open the
windows to let the breeze in until I almost had to go for dinner. Then
dinner ended up being in the same room I had been sitting in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we went down to the night market. Rows and rows of tables
piled with completely worthless shit. Worthless to me anyway.
Progressive minimalism and tourism do not see eye to eye when it comes
to the importance of physical novelties. I saw a few cool engrish shirts
though, so that was cool. The power went out just as I was crossing the
bridge to an outdoor techno club on the beach, so I stayed there at the
club and had a mango smoothie that cost approximately $1. Lot's of
things here cost approximately $1. The music was freakin awesome and I
was disappointed that nobody was dancing, or rather that there was
nobody there to dance. The place was empty, so I sat on the beach
drinking my smoothie and enjoying the techno by myself, then I began
walking home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vietnamese guy approached me and began talking to me in good english,
though with poor pronunciation. Vietnamese people are so nice it's
almost creepy, like there's some hidden agenda. It makes it hard to
gauge who you can trust, but this guy and his group of friends were all
cool so we walked a while and they took photos with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I ran into two people on the tour who are Vietnamese people from
France. I walked with them, took some photos for them, and they bought
me a beer at a stall where we sat and chatted it up with the owner. I
barely understood anything they said, but they knew a little english.
Charades was part of the game, and that's always fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came home, checked online for some friends, and came upstairs to write
in the comfort of my own room rather than in the hotel lobby. So now the
moon is higher in the sky, I may have a few additional mosquito bites,
and you know probably more details about my day than is really
necessary. I'll try to keep it shorter tomorrow...&lt;/p&gt;

I'm staying at in Ha Long Bay. It is not in my air conditioned hotel
room. The lobby is hot, and they don't refrigerate their beer so the
beer is also hot. I am dripping in sweat drinking a warm beer, and I'm
happy to have internet. (A few minutes later I opened the window and let
the cool breeze in, eliminating my sweat problem... duh.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha Long Bay is gorgeous. I would absolutely love to take off across it
on a jet ski and see all the tiny coves hidden in the cliffs on the
opposite shore. My hotel room looks out across the bay from the
non-interesting side, so my view is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll write more info about my travels from today later, right now I'm
going to enjoy this warm beer as best as I can and chat with my brother.&lt;/p&gt;

what I've seen of Vietnam. There were many cars on the streets, there
were less shanty shacks and more tall buildings, there were large
bridges, a railroad, cleaner streets. There were mountains visible in
the near distance and I liked it immediately. There was a lot of water,
big bodies of water like lakes and wide rivers. There were people
hanging around parks, having picnics, fishing from the shore wall,
parked with their scooters under shady trees, and I thought that this
would be a very fun city to live in. There are less mosquitoes and less
geckos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building architecture here is as impressive as Saigon, only there's
more of it since there are less shacks. I would love to come back some
day with a guide and a tilt/shift lens and do a whole book on the
architecture of Vietnam. The lines are so clean, the space is more... I
don't know how to describe it... less monotonous than even the
Victorians of San Francisco, which I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I noticed about Hanoi is there was art. Art had been
mostly absent on my journey so far, except mass media like TV and ads
which aren't a direct expression of the local people. Other than
architecture there have been only small examples of art. Thu's manicure
paintings which she had samples of. A man with a flute, a man with a
guitar. Tien singing. But here in Hanoi, art is prominent. There are
tiled mosaics along boulevards, many Chinese influenced decorations, and
martial arts as well, but I'll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hanoi tour started at the airport with a family of 8 and an older
Vietnamese couple from France. I was the only white person, the only
English speaker except our guide. He told me that we were going to pick
up two more people then head out for some sights. We found our way to a
hotel and found our two other people, a Vietnamese man in his 20's and
his wife, a drop-dead gorgeous, beautiful Vietnamese girl with a figure
that could start wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove on and came upon an old school of eastern philosophy. Around
the outside of the school walls there were men with mirrors hanging off
of trees or the wall itself giving people haircuts on the sidewalk.
Inside the school there were Vietnamese, French and English translations
of plaques describing what the school was about, but all of the original
text was in traditional Chinese. I hadn't been aware of the heavy
Chinese influence in Vietnamese culture until I came to Vietnam, but
it's everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on to have lunch and I was seated at the end of one table. Next
to me were the man and his beautiful wife, and to my surprise he greeted
me in English. I asked him about it and he said he didn't speak English
fluently, but had been living in Florida with his wife for several
years. Then she began speaking to me in perfect English. She was a
Vietnamese American, born in the south of Vietnam and raised in Miami.
She wondered why on earth I joined a tour without a translator and I
thought about Tien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549990/"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Hanoi hotel room" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3563/3610549990_a1422c1f7a_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After lunch we went to the hotel. I got my
key and went to my room on the second floor and discovered why this tour
might have been more expensive than I had thought. This room was nice.
It had a refrigerator in it. The refrigerator had beer and coke and
bottled water in it. There was a bath tub with warm running water. There
was air conditioning, but it didn't seem to be working. In fact nothing
electronic except the refrigerator seemed to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later found out that they have this ingenious mechanism in this hotel
where all non-essential electronics are hooked to one circuit and all
essential electronics are hooked to another. When you enter the room you
insert the room key into a little slot and this turns on the
non-essential circuit. When you leave you take your key and all of the
lights, TV, fan, etc. turn off. I imagine this is pretty important in a
city where the power lines are in such atrocious conditions. I even saw
a a power junction pole on fire yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know this about the electricity yet though, but that did not
stop me from cracking open a Tiger beer, running a hot bath and relaxing
in the tub under the light of a LED flashlight that Igor bought for me
before I left. It was wonderful. I hadn't had a beer or a bath since
before leaving America a week and a half ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour continued at 4pm and we went to another pagoda with a shrine
inside of it. There are shrines everywhere around here. In Binh Hoa I
saw something that looked like a doghouse, but really it was a small
shrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549992/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pagoda in Hanoi" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/3610549992_b9babe2a14_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 158px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We had dinner on the waterfront at a good restaurant,
a modern restaurant, and there was a wedding reception going on. I saw
the first Mercedes Benz since I'd been in VN. I walked along the shore
wall and found several dead fish floating in the water and was glad I
didn't see this before dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we went back to the hotel and I was thinking about going
out on the town for a while. Hanoi is rad and I really wanted to go out
and see more of it on my own, but alas the lack of good sleep caught up
to me and I drifted off on the king sized bed and slept for nearly 10
hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I awoke at 5am the sun was already up beyond the trees and
buildings and morning light was diffusing off the sky into the park
across the street where 50 or so people were doing thai chi or some
such. I took a shower, took some photos of the building, organized my
backpack a little, and looked outside again to see even more people in
the park. They were playing badmitton on the sidewalk, doing martial
arts, thai chi, and dancing. What an interesting place Hanoi is... I
hope to come back some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 30 minutes we will leave for Ha Long bay, which is ~200km away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still haven't found free WiFi in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

Tien's sister, saw Tien and I off. One week after arriving in Binh Hoa
we were headed back to Saigon, back to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One earbud and one earplug each, Tien and I lost ourselves in music as
our bus flowed through mixed currents of scooters and buses through city
streets and country fields, stopping a few times to exchange passengers
with the outside world. At one stop I saw a slender american looking
girl appearing somewhat lost, standing next to a bus and chatting with a
metropolitan looking Vietnamese girl. I didn't get a chance to talk to
her, though I would've liked to see what she was doing out in An Giang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a man on a bicycle with a trailer that said &amp;quot;hamburger&amp;quot; and was
carrying two panes of window glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at a ferry building some vendors poked into the bus
selling sweet corn on the cob and tortillas and for a moment I forgot
what continent I was on. As the ferry approached the far side of the
river the bus driver turned on a light and yelled something back to
Tien. &amp;quot;We need to pay more because you are a foreigner.&amp;quot; I didn't care
much to argue about it, and later when I gave the driver 50,000 more he
took it and went to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on listening to music and driving through the night. On my left,
Tien fell asleep with her head on my shoulder, and the stranger on my
right did the same. I couldn't sleep though, these seats were made for
short people so I got no head rest. My neck was hurting and my head kept
falling back. We drove a long way, sometimes down dirt roads with one
lane bridges. There were countless bridges, including the beautiful My
Thuân bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we made it to Saigon and found a taxi to take us back to the
house we stayed at on my first night in Vietnam. Two familiar faces
unlocked the iron gate and let us in. By this time it was 11pm and we
had to wake up at 3:30am. This didn't stop Tien and I from staying up
late saying goodbyes and sharing the last of the time we'd have together
for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning came too early and as soon as I was done showering a taxi
was waiting outside to take us to the airport. The streets of Saigon
were very empty at 4am, so it was a quiet, dark ride. I kept thinking of
Late Night Alumni's &lt;em&gt;Sunrise Comes Too Soon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the airport we found our contact at the travel
agency. He gave me a bright orange bag and a bright orange hat which I
had no idea what to do with. I managed to stick them in my luggage
though, I thought they might come in useful. Despite wishing me well a
few times, Tien stayed with me until I was right at the security
checkpoint, which is fantastically easier to manage than american
airports. I gave her a 500,000 bill, said a final goodbye and stepped
through security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had been my translator and guide from the time I had stepped out of
the secure area, and here I was back inside it, once again without her,
headed to Hanoi. I thought about this while I was sitting at the
terminal, thinking about how she was probably crying in the taxi on the
way back to the bus station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept on the flight, somehow, and before I knew it I had landed in
Hanoi and was out walking around in the terminal, wondering where the
hell to go. I didn't see anybody with a sign that looked familiar, or
any of the folks from the tour that had been on the flight. I decided to
put on my orange hat, and no sooner had I done so than a man was
welcoming me and telling me to sit and wait for the rest of the group to
arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did. I sat and waited. I ate a Snickers bar and drank a Sprite. I
read some of &lt;em&gt;On the Road&lt;/em&gt; by Jack Kerouac. I wrote most of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday afternoon was relaxing and wonderful. Nearly heaven, nearly
zen. I was laying in the hammock in the kitchen where Tien's brother and
his wife share a double bed in a corner with their two daughters. No
sink, no oven, no refrigerator. The same spot where each night the
family members sit on the tile floor and eat their meals, happy as can
be. I was watching Tien's figure through the hammock webbing as she
washed dishes in a tub under the tin roof of the back patio, the same
place this family washes their clothes and hangs them to dry. They same
place they wash their children. I was listening to Debussy on my iPhone,
Arabesque No. 1 and some other stuff from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_Lily_Chou-Chou"&gt;All About Lily
Chou-chou&lt;/a&gt;,
the leaves of tropical trees blowing in the blue sky outside the back
door, a gecko crawling down the inside wall, a warm breeze blowing over
my body. I was charmed by this place, by its people and their good
lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't wish I could've photographed this because it's the kind of thing
you just can't photograph. Maybe a film could've captured it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien came inside and sat with me. She's very sad that I'm leaving, and
she said some preemptive goodbyes, expressed some happiness and sorrow.
It was a very bittersweet moment that lasted quite some time as we sat,
talked, found small ways to show affection for each other, enjoying the
physical company that has been missing for the last 8 years of our
friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was wearing a really cute engrish shirt. Cartoonish line drawings of
a face and some characters. &amp;quot;Beloved he has maded by yours truly love.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3599203845/"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Temple in Binh Hoa" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3599203845_72cfb0da02_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Later that night we went out on a scooter ride to
see the sunset and to go to the bank to get money that would not be
needed. Tien and I planned to take her whole family to the beach as a
way for me to show my appreciation for their hospitality, but when we
got back home her mother would not have it because of the cost. She felt
guilty for Tien and I spending too much money on it. Tien was very sad
about this, and I was disappointed but understanding. I don't know how
else to show my gratitude. I've been trying to come up with something
more original than simple monetary compensation, but have come up
fruitless in such an alien society. Plus, what do you buy for somebody
who owns 3 of about 10 local shops?&lt;/p&gt;

and I it's been a good gentle immersion in to Asian culture in the
tropics. Tonight Tien and I will go by overnight bus to Vung Tàu Beach,
which is about 20km outside Ho Chi Minh city, and spend the next day
there. Monday I plan to fly to Hanoi and do a 4 day tour at Ha Long
Beach. I'm not sure when I'll have internet access beyond today, but I
expect to have it wherever I'm staying in Hanoi since it's going to be
more of a resort style thing, a popular tourist destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My iPhone has been failing to function as a GPS receiver, which sucks
because it's the only one I brought that has a screen. I was surprised
to see that there are only 2 &lt;a class="reference external" href="htp://www.geocaching.com"&gt;geocaches&lt;/a&gt; in
Saigon, one of which was a virtual, and three in Hanoi. Looking at the
standard of living here, it makes sense, but I still expected there to
be a district where there were more, or in parks outside of town, or
something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3599203843/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Binh Hoa sky" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2440/3599203843_3a063834ca_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Last night Tien, her sister and I went to the bank to
figure out some money thing for my trip. For some reason they wouldn't
let me pay with credit, so I ended up going to the ATM outside and
pulling out 1m, took some cash from my wallet and put down 2.8m on the
trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is roughly equivalent to $160 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first went to the bank and exchanged a several 20's for a stack
of 50,000's all I could think of was Snow Crash's hyper-inflation. An
average meal can cost 20,000. A taxi ride can cost 300,000. I wonder why
they don't just drop those extra 3 zeros. I talked to Majed online and
he joked about how I left my job a millionaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got the details of the money and registration for my trip
worked out we left, and then were almost immediately called because of
an error in my name, and then called again because we didn't put down
enough money up front. When we got back to the bank it was closed. The
problem is that I have to leave on Monday, and the bank won't be open
until Monday, so I'm not sure how this is going to work out. But hey,
that's part of the fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3599203829/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Science Experiment?" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/3599203829_c1ba0754eb_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Later last night we went back to a nearby city and
had some food and drinks and tried to find a US to Asian power adapter,
which nobody has. As usual a lot of people were out enjoying the cool
night. I've found that people like night here and I assume a big reason
is because it's cooler and more conducive to style and enjoyment.
Vietnam is the only place I've been where it's common to see a
beautiful, slender girl in figure fitting clothes that you can vaguely
see through wearing high heels and riding a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to town I noticed how common it is to see platonic same-sex
affection. From what I know about the conservative guy/girl
relationships this makes sense. I saw girls walking hand in hand, and
three guys with their arms on each others shoulders. This type of thing
is common, but seeing those two in succession made me realize how
prevolent it is. I thought about how it was starkly different from
places like Paris where you see lovers when you're out at night, but
here you see friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a man on a motorbike using his right foot to push a man on a
manual-pedal tricycle down the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could do a whole photo book on the spiral staircases in Vietnam.
They're everywhere, and they're really pretty. Most nice houses have a
spiral staircase going up to the roof. Most two floor houses have a
spiral staircase going up from the back of the great room that takes up
most of the bottom floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two kinds of houses here. Single floor houses made from
cement and wood, extended with tin walls and awnings. Then there are
several floor houses which are painted, have balconies, big windows,
etc.. It's the only big difference other than quality of motorbike that
I've seen so far to distinguish poor people from rich people. It's
really awesome that there is not a huge disparity between the rich and
the poor here, not so much as in America at any rate. I like that the
majority of the people are in the middle, not at the upper and lower
ends. It's actually a lot like Yentown from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowtail_Butterfly_(film)"&gt;Swallowtail
Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;.
I noticed this a few days ago and it was a slight revelation as to why I
feel so at home here in VN. That is my favorite movie, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Tien and I sat down at the market and ate breakfast and drank
coffee again. This has been a pretty daily occurrence, and I really enjoy
it. I'll miss it. We talked about musical classification, and the larger
issue which is general classification of information and its attributes.
We talked about traveling, my trip, family, America, intelligence, jobs,
what makes a good life. I think Tien is brilliant and she just doesn't
know it. I told her so too. She asks questions beyond the obvious ones
and understands things very quickly. I think she may be a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left America many people told me I'd have terrible digestive
problems when I got here, but actually I think I've had less than I did
in San Francisco. In fact I haven't had any problems until today, and
they were incredibly minor. This is interesting to me because it's not
like I've been sticking to the &amp;quot;don't drink iced drinks and don't eat
vegetables&amp;quot; advice that my doctor gave me.&lt;/p&gt;

up. Today we're going to square that away, and tomorrow we'll probably
be going back to Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up eaten by mosquitoes, probably because I didn't
put on insect repellant before we went out last night to get some
smoothies in a nearby village. I took a shower, and when I was done I
shaved in the sink which is outside on the back porch, rain pouring
down, listening to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.prettylightsmusic.com/"&gt;Pretty Lights&lt;/a&gt;
on my iPhone. Too bad I couldn't have photographed that.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3616735672/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Scooter in the Market" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3616735672_57004ca160_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I went down to the market for breakfast and had some ramen
style soup stuff.  The american idea of breakfast as being a separate
type of meal from other meals is completely gone.  All meals are equal
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll never be impressed again when I watch a movie and somebody drives a
motorcycle through a store or through a crowded market. That happens all
the time here, but it's not some badass chasing a bad guy, it's people
like your mom and they're going shopping for teddy bear phone charms and
perfume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tien and I played hacky sack in the shop, she picked it up really
quickly! She seems to be a quick learner and skilled with her hands and
feet. After hacky sack I taught her how to juggle using the hacky sack
and two bottles of Naco cosmetic vitamin cream. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3594306843/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tien in the shop" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3301/3594306843_26ced517c1_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;She
picked up juggling equally quick. It was sad when I told her how great
she was doing and she said that other people never said things like,
never told her she was smart or talented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sat in the shop for a while and listened to music, talking about
lyrics (thank you
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pearworks.com/pages/pearLyrics.html"&gt;PearLyrics&lt;/a&gt;, damn
you big industry music companies) and how melody is greater than genre.
I'm not sure how much of what I was saying she understood, but I know
she got the idea. We played Wurdle too, which was good for her english.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked home and the power was out again, but quickly came on, then
off, then on. We had a somewhat American lunch, some kind of stew with
bread, and now we really need to figure out this weekends plans. Off to
a beach, I think, to buy some stuff I need, and then I'm off to Ha Long
bay on Monday! Or so goes the plan... One thing I learned quick, before
I even left, was that you can plan, but you don't ever really know
what's going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

options to go to Ha Long bay and to call Igor to ask him about some
comments he left concerning traveling Laos and Cambodia. Before doing
that we had a somewhat American breakfast with eggs and bread, but with
the addition of peppered soy sauce, radish and cucumber. It was really
freakin good, you should try it. It was raining pretty heavy and before
I could go online the power went out in all of Binh Hoa, which Tien said
is pretty uncommon. The rain stopped but the power was still out. Tien
and I decided to go cruise around the and take photos so we mounted up
on her scooter and headed down the tiny streets of her village. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3594306839/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Foot Bridge in Binh Hoa" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3594306839_886de55dc1_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When I say tiny, I mean about maybe 8-10 feet wide
for two-way traffic. Smaller than the sidewalks on Market Street in San
Francisco. I got to photograph the cool foot-bridge style bridges that
people ride over the rivers, and actually got off the scooter to
photograph some stuff. That's awesome because it's so hard to photograph
things from a scooter not only because things are flying by, but because
your brain composites the pieces of information that your eyes take in
and makes it appear like you have a better view than you actually do,
and the truth about this shows up in a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got home there was a terrible smell in the house, which I
thought might be due to spoiled food, but was actually some pigs that
the neighbors decided to let out in their back yard. I never got the
whole story on that, but we ended up sitting in the front room fanning
ourselves for a while until somebody filled the house with perfume and
we came inside to eat fruit and try to stay cool. Most of us ended up
napping, me in a hammock in the living room and Tien on the couch,
taking turns fanning each other. Torrential rain came back and cooled
everything down, which was nice, then Tien and I laid around some more
listening to music off my iPod. I really wish I could've gotten photos
of it because it's totally the kind of thing I'd love to photograph, but
that's the problem with experiencing things first person. The power came
back on, but now it's like 1am in San Francisco so I can't call Igor

This is
remarkable not because it's a gecko and it's inside, but because it's on
the floor. There are tons of geckos all over the walls. They chirp at
night and sometimes wake me up. They eat bugs, so that's good. Nobody
even pays attention to them except me. I asked Tien if she'd ever caught
one and she said no, and she was totally unaware that if you catch one
and pet its belly it will fall asleep. Maybe I should catch one and show
everybody how it's done.&lt;/p&gt;

a long time about language, world culture and classical music. I tried
to also explain some things about computers and networking, which was
preceded by my saying that I was intrigued by the problem of making a
better network for a place like this village and was succeeded by my
explanation of the word intrigue. While we were talking it began to rain
pretty heavily, like a flash flood. We sat near the edge of the market
and watched gallons of water pour off the tarp roofs of the stalls
outside and I told Tien and two other girls about how cold the rain was
in Colorado and how it made hail. When the rain died down Tien and I
strolled the 2 blocks back to her house and had a very anime lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3591194280/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tien" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2425/3591194280_2a3d2aa7ec_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When I say anime lunch, I mean it in the romantic comedy sense of
anime. Picture Tien's mom and a neighbor woman of the same age bringing
me a tray of fresh cooked food as I sat on the couch. Tien's niece, who
is ever sweet and thoughtful even at 4 years old, brought me water like
she often does. Two of Tien's sisters, two nieces, her mother and the
neighbor sat there around the table watching and smiling while Tien fed
food from the tray into my bowl. They all looked at me and smiled and
made jokes and talked about my looks and asked if the food was good and
asked about my wife or girlfriend and said a lot of things that Tien
didn't translate for me. Then in typical dorky anime guy style I broke
the chair I was sitting on when I got up to get some medicine from my
bag. (Lord knows I couldn't get up to get anything but what was
exclusively under my control, the women would have to get it for me.) By
this time three other girls had come in, so there I was breaking the
chair I sat in while about 8 asian females watched and laughed at me.
The food was delicious though, and I ate it with chopsticks from a bowl.
They all smiled at me and watched me eat until I was full, sitting next
to that broken chair. Then they made me go take a nap, but when I went
to lay in the hammock the frame of it fell backwards and I nearly broke
the glass in a cabinet while pulling a muscle in my arm and dropping my
laptop on the floor. Of course everybody around laughed at me, and I
taught Tien the word &amp;quot;klutz.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that not so cliché anime? All I could think of was Kimagure Orange
Road or Tenchi Muyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I finally got safely into the hammock and Tien and I finally
agreed that neither of us should feel bad or embarrassed about what just
happened we sat and talked for another long while about cultural
differences, the mix of culture, non-ethnically defined culture which is
often found in America, and the difficulties encountered when cultures
blend and break. A lot of this stemmed off of a common idea that Tien
and I might get married, which isn't going to happen of course but
Vietnamese culture leads its people to that conclusion when they see her
and I together, and the difficulties between men and women of different
cultures. For instance, I would've loved to stop talking to make out
with Tien but her more conservative Vietnamese culture won't allow that
to happen, so instead we just talked about how difficult and frustrating
these things can be and then I took a nap, which wasn't nearly as
fulfilling as making out would've been.&lt;/p&gt;

hotel room. Mai showed up shortly afterwards and brought me back to
their house where we ate and talked and showered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eat frequently here, though not a lot. There are 8 females in this
house and it seems like every time I turn around one of them is offering
me a fruit or giving me a drink or telling me to sit down while they
point the fan where I should sit. It's a little overwhelming because I
don't really know how to respond. I feel so indebted to Tien's family
but I don't know how to repay them. They won't even let me pay for
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I showered, Mai, Tien, their mom and I piled onto two scooters and
rode for a few hours to Câm Mountain.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3591194324/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Vietnam Cruisin' 2009" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3591194324_2d1d5b9a66_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw two girls sharing a bicycle. The one in front pedaled while the
girl in back upshed off the ground, then when they got moving they both
put their feet on the pedals side by side and pedaled off together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a white guy riding a bicycle and it was really odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came across a boat race on the Hâu river while we were on our way to
Câm Mountain. We rode along next to this river for a long time. The road
was on a burm between two waterways that irrigated rice paddies. The
rice paddies were some of the most beautiful sights I'd seen, so green
and stretching on to the horizon with geometric lines running through
them and flags placed here and there. The paddies were only visible
through the gaps between shacks built off of the burm, standing up on
stilts. These were some of the most poor shelters I've ever seen. Tin
shacks on wooden stilts with wooden floors. Some had docks going down
towards the water where people could board boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were lots of boats. We passed a ship yard where people were
welding together barge type boats. There were hand-powered boats that
you'd row or push with a stick. There were boats with long outboard
motors. There were wooden foot-bridges that rose up over the river in a
large arc that was too steep for most bicyclists to bike over, but not
too steep or weak for somebody to ride over on a scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you, Vietnam is all about scooters. Tien says you have to be 18
to ride a motorbike, but it doesn't seem that way. People go to street
fares and never get off their scooters. They sit on them like they're
chairs while they watch live performances on a stage in the center of a
wide boulevard. They wait outside of to-go restaurants and the employees
bring the food out to you on a scooter. They watched the boat race and
never got off their scooters. They love their scooters. They wash them
all the time. I even saw a guy washing his scooter wheels using the
muddy water of a puddle at the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped in a town called Châu Dôc and went to a Budhist temple where
we ate lychees and Tien's family prayed. The other women at the temple
loved this blue accented straw hat I was wearing and wanted to try it
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw chickens eating fruit that looked like a coconut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rode some distance more until we got to the foot of the mountain
where we found a local shop to watch our scooters. People never leave
their scooters unattended. Part of going to a restaurant is that they
watch your scooter and will park it for you if needed. This usually
involves putting it in neutral and rolling it up tightly next to another
scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had originally intended to hike up the mountain but it was getting
late, so instead we hired 4 guides to give us a motorcycle tour of the
mountain and the temple at the top. It was a steep ride up the mountain,
15% grade in some parts (thankfully grade signs are universal.) We rode
over dirt and cobble stone sidewalks right next to vendors where people
were walking until we got to this huge statue of Buddha where people
were praying and vendors were selling incense and kids were plaing with
toy laser guns that made irreverent noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we went around a lake to the temple which had a large pagoda
and two small ones next to it. One of the great things about temples is
that street vendors can't go onto the temple property, which keeps them
quiet and calm and peaceful. It's an amazing difference from the beeping
of scooters, zapping of toy laser guns, jabbering of street vendors,
etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow Tien's mom managed to get one of the monks to unlock the 8 story
tall pagoda and walk with us up to the top. Tien and Mai stopped at each
level to pray, and I was allowed to take photos, unlike in the temple
where I wasn't allowed to take photos or even go inside. The view from
the pagoda was really great. It was hard for me to show how excited I
was without being irreverent, and it ended up coming off as me being
unimpressed, so I had to make up for it when we got back to the bottom
by talking on and on about how beautiful it was. And it really was
awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've gotten used to is attention. I've only seen 4
white people in Vietnam so far. Everybody turns their head as you pass,
and some shout out &amp;quot;hello!&amp;quot; and wave to you. Some just say &amp;quot;oi!&amp;quot; At the
bottom of the pagoda there was a guy with his family who I had seen at
the Buddha. This guy, maybe a high school student, was unabashedly
taking a photo of me with his cell phone, moving so that he was always
in front of me. I posed and joked at him for taking too long, but I'm
sure he didn't understand a word of what I said. His family all laughed
and smiled and we all thought it was pretty funny. People here love my
light eyes, straight nose and my dimples. As we were leaving they said
&amp;quot;Goodbye! See you later!&amp;quot; which I thought was pretty funny since I would
almost certainly not see them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a quick stop off at another small temple they were building at
the side of the lake. This quick stop involved riding down a dirt trail
and over a bridge with two large humps in it, then through a sparse
forest up to the foot of the temple. There were vendors beyond the
safety of the temple property, one was selling some kind of rodent,
maybe a furry kind of mouse or a squirrel, in tiny cages. After this we
headed down the steep mountain and wound up at the bottom reclining in
hammocks eating lychees and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We piled back on our scooters and headed the 75km or so back home. Mai
and I listened to music, the sun set over the rice paddies, people were
out on the roads relaxing and watching the traffic, all turning their
heads at me and saying &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; from time to time. We didn't get home
until after a dark ride down what was basically a sidewalk that
supported two-way foot, bicycle and scooter traffic through into the
town where Tien lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed at their place last night. It rained like a monsoon in the
middle of the night. I awoke to the now familiar sounds of Vietnam:
scooter and truck horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I need to figure out where I'll be going next... It's been
difficult because Tien wont' be coming with me, so we have to find
places where people will speak english. I'm thinking about taking a 4
day trip to Ha Long Bay, then maybe going to Singapore instead of up
through Cambodia and Lao. This language thing sucks... where is Mandarax
when you need it?&lt;/p&gt;

through a warm gentle rain, sharing an earbud with Mai listening to
Kaskade off my non-phone-functioning iPhone, watching the strange
surroundings illuminate from the shadows in the headlight of the
scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I walked around the market where Tien's parents own two
stores, talking to the local villagers (through Tien) who all turned
their heads at me as they walked by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw two feral lawn darts nipping at each other in the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I saw a woman selling cake on a bridge over a river next to a
slum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw two girls biking down a bridge on a bicycle with a bent back
wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It smells like death and rotting fruit a lot in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man looked at me as he passed by on his scooter, a segmented cage full
of field mice on the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For lunch I had one of the best meals I've ever had. Tien's mom cooked
some amazing fried chicken with some amazing sauce brazed on and some
other amazing dipping sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner I ate a fish tasting thing with a bunch of tentacles of
varying lengths and nobody could tell me what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of respect for cultural customs Tien decided it would be a bad idea
to travel with me and I'm a little worried about how things will be in a
few days when she's not around to translate for me. I'm also bummed that
she won't be traveling with me, it would've been great for her, and
great fun for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing the bathroom in this hotel room, I'm glad I took Igor's
advice and got a sleeping bag liner to sleep in.&lt;/p&gt;

that would sum it up. Scooters. It's like everything here is a scooter.
I see people doing everything possible with them, from selling corn to
hauling TV's 4 at a time. It's actually really really awesome, the
dynamic of traffic with so many of these things. Everything looks so
chaotic at first but as you experience it you find the order and it's
remarkable. For instance, you'd think it would not be possible to cross
a street where there are no stop signs and no cross-walks with like 100
scooters coming by every minute, but it's not true. You just cross the
street. You do it slowly and calculated, and everything just flows
around you.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3582781223/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Crossing the Street" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3317/3582781223_816a9ef082_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 161px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this city that I've seen so far is amazing too, in some good
ways and some bad ways that add up to awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture here is fantastic, I haven't seen one building that
isn't interesting in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's this river that flows around here, more like a canal, and it's
black as crude oil and smells like death with trash floating on the top
and people actually fish in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are chickens walking around outside of restaurants where they
serve chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people here have figures that americans would pay personal
trainers big bucks to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw two girls sharing a bicycle eating ice cream. The one in front had
her right foot on the right pedal and her left foot on the neck of the
frame. The girl in back had her left foot on the left pedal and her
right foot on the rear fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a whole family on a single scooter passing us in heavy traffic at
like 25km/h, something that is a bit frightening, but then you see these
same people taking their kids to the amusement park to put them on a
kiddie train that goes like 4km/h and call it entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have these scooter repair shops where you ride up and let somebody
fix your scooter while you sit back drink and smoke cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People's houses don't have garages, they just have entry ways with
double-doors where you ride your scooter straight into the house and
park it there, inside the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every shop on the street just has a wide open front, no front
wall, and you ride your scooter right up to the front, park and walk in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have three-wheeled motor trikes with cargo areas in the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a million shops just selling scrap metal. You see people
outside welding stuff together or running spools of metal through
machines that straighten them out into rebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have showers where there is no separate shower stall, you just
shower on the tile floor of the bathroom and the water washes off to a
corner drain, which I think is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I still haven't found any plugs that work with my laptop
and haven't found a converter, so I don't have photos to post just now,
but will soon.&lt;/p&gt;

an open patio where Vietnamese men were sitting with laptop computers
smoking cigarettes while sipping iced coffee with run and listening to
loud Japanese music like Maximum the Hormone and Megumi Hayashibara. I'm
wondering when I'll get sick from the ice and water, but so far so good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am in the waiting area of Narita International Airport where
I've already gotten lost and ended up on the wrong side of the airport,
but I had planned on strolling around anyways to check out the
architecture, culture, girls, etc.. I found engrish shirts, crazy
electronic devices and toys, stores with Japanese art. I wonder what
it's like outside the airport though, airports never give the whole
picture of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people are great. It seems like everybody here has a different
radiance. Even on the flight I was amazed at something extra in the
stuardess' demeanor. Perhaps it's one of those eastern things. Many
people seem jovial and friendly, though I can't understand almost
anybody and they're not all speaking Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is the same though, IT related stuff is still a pile of crap.
I can't get online to save my life right now because Boingo has a crummy
sign-in process with a glacial credit card authentication server. No

airplane sleep barely counts and I'm tired as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to pack all of my things into a small frame backpack (the
Osprey Atmos 35) and despite it being slightly larger than regulation
for carry-on baggage, the cute Japanese girl at ANA said I could carry
it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I slept well, deep, with little or no stressful worry. When
my body began waking up it was only 5:30am or so. It's weird, but ever
since I moved out of my apartment and essentially became homeless, I
have become a morning person. I've been living in my car for a month now
and I'm still getting used to my body wanting to wake up early. This
morning I just fought it and tried to sleep more, but ended up just
tossing and turning and feeling achy until 7. I finally woke up, let
droog off the leash so he could run around, took some photos, said
goodbye to Will and Maks and then got in my car with Lila driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for gas and coffee down in Saratoga. When the barista asked
me how I was doing I said &amp;quot;Great! I quit my job and I'm flying to Asia!&amp;quot;
It feels good to excitedly state exactly what I'm doing in life, even
when it's mundane, but when it's something big it carries a little extra
weight and helps me realize the whole situation.&lt;/p&gt;

neck pillow are in the top-rear pocket along with two iPods, two sets of
headphones and the Apple airplane power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of things I am taking is pretty slim. Other than my camera
and computer, I only have toiletries, one pair of pants, one pair of
shorts, a few pairs of underwear, and a few books. The backpack I
selected has plenty of room. I still have to iron out the details of
keeping things organized, but that'll come with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm just really tired... I need a good night's sleep. I'll
write more about the last few days once I'm on the plane to Tokyo, but
now it's time to enjoy the last bit of good sleep I'll probably get for
a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up and wasn't sure where I was. The feel of the bed
and the Wall•E bed set reminded me that I realized I was in Maks' room.
Looking out of the window where I'd normally see Monterey I saw only
white. The sun was up and we were sitting on a bed of clouds that were
nestled in the valleys below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to work I was delighted to find my passport and my Vietnam
visa waiting for me in a FedEx envelope. I promptly scanned them and
made two color copies. Now I just need Laos and Cambodia... by tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over my lunch I headed to Kaiser to get my last shot before leaving. The
nurse was nice and good humored, and had been to Singapore a few years
ago, so we were chatting it up. As she rolled up my sleeve I consciously
relaxed and repeated the word &amp;quot;relax.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stuck me and said &amp;quot;This is nothing, I've heard horror stories about
some countries over there, people getting drugged up on opium and waking
up in some torture camp--&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please don't say things like that while you have a needle in my arm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren and I were talking about her upcoming trip to Austrialia. She was
melancholy about it, spending a month in Queensland a few miles outside
of a small town in a remote location. I was telling her she should find
it to be a vacation, a joy to have time off. She was free to ride bikes
or motorcycles, paint, draw, take pictures, sleep, tan, read books, do
whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then occurred to me that this is exactly what I will have time to do
in Asia. It is exactly what I will have time to do after Friday when I
have no job. It was an inspiring realization that the effort I'm going
through to take this trip is actually for good reason. So much of this
preparation has been going through the necessary motions, and I haven't
taken much time to anticipate the relaxing and awesome free time I will
have. I think I've just removed myself from the reality and gone through
the motions because it's such a drastic life change, and the effect of
that is that I've neglected much of the positive excitement that goes
along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, after Friday I won't have a job. Sure, after Friday I will be in a
country where I don't speak the primary language. Sure, after Friday
I'll be 5,000 miles away from the nearest familiar place. It's still
exciting, it's still great, and it can still be very very very awesome.
I sometimes just forget that aspect of this, as if it's a chore.&lt;/p&gt;

Lisa, she forgot it was her last day at work and had to work until 7, so
Donna and I went without her. We went to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/goldengatepark"&gt;Golden Gate
Park&lt;/a&gt; with
the intent of finding &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/faq.aspx"&gt;travel
bugs&lt;/a&gt; for me to take to
Asia. We went to two lakes and a waterfall on an island before heading
back to the car with a travel bug and a geocoin. Afterwards we went
downtown and wandered around taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were walking down Mission near 5th, a photo in a gallery window
caught my eye and we went in to see it. It actually didn't look like a
photo at all, more like a painting, but ended up being a photo printed
on canvas which made it look more like a painting. We talked to a man
working in the gallery and he told us that the photographer, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://summit-photo.com"&gt;Patrick
Davis&lt;/a&gt;, teaches photography at San Jose
State. When I told him we had to go he invited us to come back and drink
wine or coffee and look around the gallery any time we wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed Mission and went to visit Lisa at work. That was great, I
hadn't seen her in what seems like ages but is probably only a few
weeks. Donna and I got coffee and chatted with Lisa a bit, but she was
busy working so we let her be and went back outside. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3563631378/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Napping in the park" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3568/3563631378_c759646682_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The weather was still really bleak and we were both tired from
walking so much so we went and took a nap in Yerba Buena Garden. I
nabbed another geocache real quick, but there were no trackables in it.
A while later we got up, walked by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/zeum-carousel-san-francisco"&gt;Zeum
Carousel&lt;/a&gt; and
ended up wandering around SOMA for a while trying to find where we'd
parked the car, taking more pictures down random alleys where we found
several hidden bars and restaurants next to smashed car windows and
empty graffitied lots fenced off with chain link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually found the car. On the way home it was still overcast and
we were still tired, but the day had been good. We listened to Claude
Debussy. His music has a way of making melancholy wonderful, so it was a
nice compliment to the wonderful day Donna and I made despite the
melancholy weather. In the Sunset district of San Francisco it's common
for people to leave unwanted things on the street for other people to
pick up, and Donna spotted a beautiful, dark wooden dresser carved and
colored with birds and branches. Piano melodies poured out of the
passenger door into the greyness as we tried to fit this piece of
furniture among the belongings I was already been carrying with me. We
fit it in the trunk and took it the one block back to 4211, our final
treasure found that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at her home we geeked out and I nearly broke my head trying to
figure out some some Wordpress plugin stuff before realizing I was
trying way too hard. Wordpress is pretty awesome. I helped Lauren move
some of her stuff across the street to her new apartment then drifted
off sipping on wine listening to the music Donna had on while she played
online scrabble with her friend in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

been thinking about heading back to the south bay. This is the freedom
that being a vagabond gives you. Instead of doing that when I woke up on

through them on the go over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I went and bought some of my gear for my trip: a new backpack,
a travel towel, a few more things like that. I'm stoked about my
backpack, it's really comfortable and is a good size. The weight of the
camera and laptop is now my only big concern. I'm still considering
loading up Windows XP on my netbook and just taking that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave Donna another stick-shift lesson yesterday. She's probably going
to buy my car when I leave and didn't know how to drive stick yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner, Rob, Donna and I headed to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/magnolia-pub-and-brewery-san-francisco"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt;
and met up with Lily. Good drinks, good food, good company. We stopped
off at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/club-deluxe-san-francisco"&gt;Club
Deluxe&lt;/a&gt; on the way
home for drinks; they have fantastic mojito's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, blogging on a bleak Sunday morning in San Francisco in a
coffee shop in my old neighborhood at the end of the N train right by
the beach, wondering what to make of this day, my last Sunday in San
Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may go geocaching with Lisa... need to pick up some travel bugs to
take with me.&lt;/p&gt;

and pick up some stuff I had left up there. On the way up to SF to meet
Rob and Donna for dinner I stopped to take some photos of the clouds
spilling over the mountain range into the valley. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3556299906/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Foothills Park Sunset" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3368/3556299906_24313f1887_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is something I see frequently, but haven't ever captured
the way I'd like to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to SF and Rob was out front of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/eliza-restaurant-san-francisco"&gt;Eliza's&lt;/a&gt;
smoking a cigar. The driver of Donna's bus kicked everybody off so he
could go to the bus depot, so she was a little late. Rob and I went into
a bar on the corner to kill time. It just so happened that this bar had
Singapore Slings on the menu, so in gonzo style, and in honor of my trip
to Asia, we ordered two of them. Neither of us had ever had one, and
they were pretty tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna showed up just in time for us to finish so we popped next door and
had a ƒ amazing Chinese meal. Eliza's has the best hot and sour soup
ever. Seriously. It's really really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we had picked Eliza's is because it was near a venue
we were going to catch a show at later. Some folks that Rob knows online
from MN were performing at the Retox Lounge. One for the Team was the
name of the band, and we got there in time to catch a few of their
songs. Incidentally they are headed to Colorado Springs, so if you're in
the area keep an eye out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a girl there giving peanut butter cookies away. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3556262020/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bad Boys on fire" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2460/3556262020_7f47528b84_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Rob had seen her at the Phenomonauts show where she was also
giving cookies away. She said that she always brings baked goods for the
band and fans of the shows she goes to. She also said that this was her
second time at Retox. The first time she saw a band perform there they
had a lead singer dressed in a suit made from dildos and band members
who were all wearing diapers. Her cookies were delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band coming up after them was a psychobilly band that Rob had seen a
few times, Bad Men. They were really awesome. Talented musicians, good
vibe, and to top it off they lit their instruments on fire for the last
song. How the hell can you top that? Accordingly, we left shortly after
their set was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back to 4211 I didn't make a single wrong turn. For the first
time ever. Just in time for me to leave town.&lt;/p&gt;

Port my phone number onto a pay-as-you-go phone. Buy bug repellent. Roll

&lt;p&gt;Last night I picked
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/lily"&gt;Lily&lt;/a&gt; up from her
friends house and introduced her to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/kyung"&gt;Kyung&lt;/a&gt; and Kat,
then we all went out for dinner at the Pruneyard. I'm trying to get my
fill of American food before I leave and I think I'm nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is going good, it's strange to think that in a week I won't have a
job. Then again, I think that large change will just be overshadowed by
living out of a backpack in a different country. I wonder how long I'll
be able to afford these changes...&lt;/p&gt;

with friends in Santa Cruz, so yesterday Blake and I headed down there
to enjoy some time on the water. This was going to be Blake's first time
sailing. It was a small group, just 9 of us. The weather was beautiful,
the ocean was calm, the wind was light, so the sailing was peaceful and
warm. I was really happy with the photos I got, partly because the sails
were working as huge light bouncers to fill in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the guys who was with us this week was a helicopter pilot for a
ski outfit in Canada, and his girlfriend was a chef at the same resort.
They were out traveling and stopped through Santa Cruz to catch up with
Carl, on of the regulars on the boat. It's great to meet other people
who are traveling and doing exciting things, it's really inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sailing, Bernadette, Sasha, Blake and I got pizza, then Blake
headed back to Vallejo and I went home with Bernadette and Sasha. I
slept on B's air mattress and it was surprisingly comfortable. Sasha and
I made pancakes for breakfast and then Bernadette dropped me back off at
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 more days of work left.&lt;/p&gt;

Jason Nassi to a great mom and pop style Mexican place called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/las-palmas-san-jose"&gt;Las
Palmas&lt;/a&gt; near downtown
San Jose. The food was good in the &amp;quot;cooked at home&amp;quot; sense and we all
enjoyed it. We talked about traveling, work, culture. Good times with
good people and good conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed back up to Lila's house in the last bit of daylight and got
somewhat lost on the way. I took a wrong turn early on and didn't
realize it until I'd driven about 8 miles through the forest on a
winding road up the side of a mountain. Thankfully I'd made that wrong
turn before, and had even come out this way on casual drives to take
photos and whatnot, so I at least knew where I was. The problem is that
I had to drive about 5 miles on a one lane road to get to where I needed
to be. On this road there were many tire tracks showing that impatient
drivers had come into worse times than merely being lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to Lila's house late and hung out with her and Maks a bit, looking
at the stars and drinking tea and playing with the pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3548643309/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morning dog" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3593/3548643309_6063e2881a_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This morning I woke up early to a cat bell and a wet dog
nose. Droog tries to squirm his way between me and whatever I'm laying
on any time he wants to be petted. DJ, the cat, was purring like a tiny
motorized cuddle machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showered and then went outside to take photos of the beautiful morning
and play fetch with Droog by throwing small logs down the driveway. You
have to use logs because if you use sticks he just chews them up and
spits them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lila and I talked about her time at Berkeley along the correct route
down the mountain, and I made a mental note of where I went wrong in the
dark last night. We stopped in Los Gatos for breakfast and coffee. More
good conversation with good company. I hope I continue to have good
fortune on my travels, especially when I actually start traveling rather
than just being vagabond in my own area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 days left until I'm sitting in the airport waiting for a flight to
Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

spot with IT support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my lunch break I had my last dental appointment before my trip.
Nothing special there, but medical things are important to handle before
leaving because not only will I be in some questionable spots as far as
medical support is concerned, I will also not have medical coverage
since I am leaving my job and all of its benefits behind. Goodbye free
dental care. Goodbye $5 immunization shots. Goodbye 401k.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3092339782/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Allison Town" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3104/3092339782_e33698169b_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work I headed up to SF to hang out with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3165305187/"&gt;Shannon&lt;/a&gt;, but
she was gone by the time I got there. She was in from out of town and
left early for some reason. Such is the nature of the traveler; we have
to enjoy their company when they are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to dinner with Donna, Lily and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3092339782/"&gt;Allison&lt;/a&gt; at a
great Italian place near Allison's place up in North Beach,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sodinis-green-valley-restaurant-san-francisco"&gt;Sodini's&lt;/a&gt;.
I have to say, their lasagna was on par with that of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-stinking-rose-san-francisco"&gt;The Stinking
Rose&lt;/a&gt;. It
was good to catch up with Allison since she's leaving SF this Friday to
move back to SoCal. When we were done the weather had turned from chilly
to really really cold wind and fog, which is weird since it was 90º on
Sunday. Donna and I headed back to 4211 where
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/brianna"&gt;Brianna&lt;/a&gt; was
nursing a boil burn on her leg and making some kind of Mexican dinner
with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/terresina"&gt;Terresina&lt;/a&gt;.
Somehow I drifted off to sleep on the couch, waking up several times
during the night as people came and went, and woke to a foggy, wet Ocean
Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 miles south in Daly City the fog was so thick you couldn't see more
than 100 feet ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 miles south in Colma the sun was out and it was warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 miles south in Cupertino I arrived at the office under an overcast
sky. 8 more days of work.&lt;/p&gt;

right now, as home as 4211 is. I have a dog and two cats nearby, a glass

&lt;p&gt;Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Russian guy I knew, Maxim, once said those words while siting shotgun
in my car as we were leaving the Colorado Springs airport. He had just
gotten back from a trip to Chicago. I put on some Russian techno when I
picked him up, something that might be familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He leaned his seat back, put his hands behind his head and said
something like &amp;quot;Ah, Russian techno! I know this, it is good. It feels
like my home... Chicago was great. I was in my hotel room, in my
jacuzzi, smoking a cigar and listening to music, and I thought to myself
'life is good.' Life is good...&amp;quot; He said this last phrase with a nod and
a particularly rich Russian accent, and it has always stuck in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I am sitting up here with a priceless view on the desk of my
Russian boss's house. Having eaten a home cooked Russian meal, playing
with the animals and intermittently giving my opinions on business a
conversation taking place between Lila, Dimitri and Will... Drinking
wine, hearing only the jingle of the cat's bell and other domesticated
animal sounds... I think that Maxim was right, life is good.&lt;/p&gt;

4211. Shannon and Lily were already well into their evening somewhere
out in the city and I was pretty late meeting up with them. Brianna
decided to go out, so we got in the car and headed to Mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems were these... I couldn't get in touch with either Shannon
or Lily, and Brianna just flat out didn't want to go to this thing she
was supposed to go to. At the venue, she decided to go my way instead
and we ended up driving around Soma for a while trying to come up with
something enjoyable to do on minimal energy and money. During our nearly
fruitless brainstorming I finally got in touch with Shannon who told us
where to go, and where to go was a pretty shady neighborhood...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 30 minutes of looking for parking, Brianna and I made our way up
to within a block of the bar before I asked her if she'd locked her
door, then we went back to the car and thought this through... See, the
neighborhood we were in was not exactly a great place. There were
junkies and cops pretty much everywhere. On top of that, I think that on
our walk we found the epicenter of transvestite culture in San
Francisco. Post and Polk is home to Diva's. I can't tell you much about
the bar since we didn't go inside, but judging by the fake tits and
adam's apples in mini skirts and stiletto's outside, I got a pretty
accurate picture of what to expect. Brianna got a gracious compliment,
&amp;quot;she doesn't even look like a man&amp;quot;, though it could've been simply about
her beauty, or that we were not recovering from addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go back to the bar and at least have one drink. On the way
we passed a junkie clinic where a man saw me walking with Brianna and
said frankly &amp;quot;you're a lucky man.&amp;quot; I can only imagine he had an unspoken
&amp;quot;because she's actually a girl&amp;quot; on the end of that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place we were going, Cafe Royale, was actually an awesome bar more
towards the less deviant end of the street. We finally met up with
Shannon, Lily and Scott and had a few good drinks, good laughs, and
generally had a great time. A few hours later the girls piled into my
car and headed back to 4211.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow the girls are doing Bay to Breakers, as are about 100,000 other
people. I'm not, though, since crowds that big really don't do it for
me. I'm not sure what I'll do, but I plan to head down to Lila's house
in the afternoon and perhaps take her Ducati out for a spin...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just realized I didn't take any photos tonight. I really ought to pick
up a pocket camera to keep this a photo blog and not just a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake, Steven and I are out catching the beautiful sights on our way
down Highway 1 to Santa Cruz. Just out for a drive and are going to meet
up with Sara, Karen, Brad and Misty. Misty recently went to Vietnam so
I've been picking her brain, but this is the first time I'll get
face-to-face since she's been back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, Donna and I got some wine and beer then caught the 71 down
to Haight to catch a show that one of Donna's friends was putting on
with his band, Dead Western. It was a party bus off the bat, as soon as
we got on some guy commented on Donna's captain hat and told us a story
about his apartment building in NYC having an explosive sewage problem.
One of his friends came over wearing a captain hat and set a little sail
boat on the raw sewage to sail it around. The people you meet randomly
have the most interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off in upper Haight and went to Slice of New York and got some
pizza. I've decided that I'm not going to eat any Asian food until I
actually get to Asia. That way I can get sick of American, Italian and
Mexican food and hopefully will not crave it so much when I can't get
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met up with Dead Western and hung out before the show. I called up my
friend Ben Random and invited him down, he only lives a block away from
the venue. He showed up and brought his Panasonic LX3, which I'm
thinking about picking up for my trip. Now, I'm really really thinking

&lt;p&gt;After the show I caught the N to 4211 and crashed on the couch with
Brianna for a bit until we went back to her own bed and I fell fast
asleep and had strange dreams about people from Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

get my Visas for Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. It's funny how my mind
works, I get so much good thinking done when I should be in deep sleep.
And by &amp;quot;funny&amp;quot; I mean &amp;quot;kinda lame.&amp;quot; Anyhow, I nearly startled awake on
the couch at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/4211"&gt;4211&lt;/a&gt; #1 this
morning with the realization that I'd forgotten this folder that I'm
keeping all of my Asia documents in, and with that as my number one
priority for the day I got in my car and started driving straight to the
coffee shop. Then I drove straight to the office, 50 miles away, with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Sunrise-DJ-Tiësto/dp/B00005NHKL"&gt;DJ Tiesto - In Search of
Sunrise&lt;/a&gt;
in the speakers. Life is always better with a soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the office there was a woman standing with her baby in the
center of the road into the parking lot of my office building. This
reminded me of something that has struck me lately... I've noticed that
the people who live in the new condos they build next door have what I
would consider to be a very miserable existence concerning their
neighborhood. &lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3312394653/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Forget lost beauty" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3629/3312394653_d8ab9c1191_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I see people walking their dogs and
taking their babies out for strolls through our parking lot, which
amazes me because there's a beautiful field in the exact opposite
direction. (And I mean beautiful in respect to what you tend to find in
the middle of a populated metroplex. Untended with small animal wildlife
doing their small wild animal things.) The area has been under
construction for the last 4 years. The mall next door has been going out
of business for longer than I've lived in the Bay Area. Even just the
other day a woman I met on the street who just arrived from Taiwan and
was lost told me she went into the mall and thought it was closed
because almost nobody was inside. Even though there is some beauty to be
found around here it seems so odd or incomplete or mismatched, seeing
somebody raise their family around that same poorly engineered, crummy
parking lot in an eternal construction zone on the corner of a freeway
exit at one of the most accident prone intersections in the South Bay. I
just don't understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have our likes and dislikes, and who knows? Maybe they like just
having a place to call their own. As for me, I'm out. Just 2 weeks until
I'm sitting in Saigon discovering other ways of life that I don't
understand.&lt;/p&gt;

Asia is the possibility of getting robbed or having my possessions
stolen. The security minded individual would then immediately consider
ways to keep private data private in such an instance, and that is
exactly what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still not sure what laptop I'm going to take with me. It's currently
between the two laptops that I own, the 15&amp;quot; Macbook and the MSI Wind. I
prefer OS X to Linux, but the smaller Wind is definitely tempting. I had
originally bought it to use as a hackintosh, but once again I decided
that with the ease-of-use of the Apple platform, you really do get what
you pay for. The Wind sucks for running OS X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from hardware size, the security features look to be about the
same. Both Ubuntu and OS X allow you to encrypt the home folder of your
user so you have to be logged in for it to be readable by anybody. Both
allow you to require a password to wake it up or come out of
screensaver. Restarting will log you out and render your personal data
safe and sound from unauthorized eyes. Incidentally, the behind the
scenes technology is pretty much the same too. An encrypted disk image
is stored in your home folder and is then mounted in place of your
directory. No rocket science there, but worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that linux does offer is the ability to have an encrypted
partition which could be mounted on /home or wherever. This becomes
interesting to me when I think about my personal
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; installation. I
want to make sure my mysql tables are not stored in the clear because
they contain sensitive info. The problems come in at boot time when
mysql starts up because if the password to unlock the encrypted
partition hasn't been entered yet mysql will fail to start. I'm still
trying to work out a way to do this gracefully, and may simply not do it
at all if there's no elegant solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to hear feedback from anybody who has done a
filesystem-level encryption of a mysql db successfully, especially in an
environment that isn't running for months at a time, but is rebooted
periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

All but the most direct sentiments are often lost on me. And the bed?
Bleh, what a waste of money that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake got into SF tonight but I didn't have time to see him yet. This
weekend for sure though. Shannon is also coming to visit SF this weekend
so I'll get to see her. Catching up with these people is good, I have

at 99 Chickens in Santa Clara. Driving towards 101 on Great America
Parkway with Kaskade on, anticipating the freeway with that electronic
music pouring in my ears and filling my veins, I recalled some of the
exciting appeal of the South Bay. Like most lifestyles, it can be
awesome if you know how it works and know how to find the joys in it. I
also think that it's easier to enjoy the South Bay when you are
comfortable driving long distances to go to the places you know you will
enjoy, and hence it will get better the more time you spend in the SFBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A girl named Megan Lau from Logitech came to my office to let me and Ray
Sennewald review some pre-release gear. For compensation she hooked us
both up with some logitech gear, and ga ve me a cool travel mouse that
will be very handy while I'm out on the road. I also got a webcam that
I'm not sure what to do with. It would've been great back at 4211 when
John was always stalking us at night.&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3529279863/"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3608/3529279863_70ca7d6596_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work I met up with Chelsea. We had dinner at Erik's and then tried
out Beard Pappa's, which was underwhelming. Then we went hiking and
photographing up on Long Ridge. It was gorgeous, as it often is, and
this time it was nice to have a beautiful girl to photograph, and of
course it was good to have good company. We cruised back to Cupertino
and had tea at a coffee shop up on Foothills where cyclists often meet
before heading out into the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at Gecko's it was nice to have a cottage to come home to, quiet and
homely. The Caltrain woke me up in the morning briefly, then sprinklers
after that. Unfamiliar sounds. I should get used to that. It was nice to
have a hot shower, which I sometimes have been going without lately, and
it would've been really nice to have a hot bath but I couldn't find
anything to plug the tub. I endured the patience testing madness that is
101 traffic via car and stopped off at Cafe Dolce for breakfast for old
time's sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that I've finished my breakfast burrito and am sipping on a
white mocha, I remember that I need to take my typhoid pills at least
two hours after eating and at least one hour before. Hm. =/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to Sunset after How Weird and hit up Noriega Pizza with
Donna to unwind. We hung out with Lauren in her new place for a few
minutes before coming back to the couch and cozy chair at 4211 #1 to use
laptops and do online things. I'm crashing here tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

disgusting bathroom I'd ever been in. Right as I was finishing that
Karen showed up and we went geocaching in Golden Gate park. We found the
casting ponds by the Anglers Lodge, really cool area. Hit up Shanghai
Dumpling King afterwards, tried to catch the fireworks of the K-fog
Kaboom after that, then stopped by a Tea Party at 4211 #1 for a while
before heading back to Rob's. Karen took one of my bean bag chairs and a
large photograph, which was really helpful because that's just less
shizz for me to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the How Weird Festival 2009, so I might head down there with
Karen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost totally forgot about Mother's day, so the least I can do is
call. I think G-funk is back in the flower business, maybe I'll have him

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I just got a GPS for my camera. This is so I can keep
track of where I take photos without having to know exactly where I am,
remember that and go back to manually geotag those photos. I think this
is worth it because I want to be sure to remember the beautiful
locations I find, and I expect to not exactly know where I am every
moment of every day. It'll also help with journaling my trip and
figuring out where I sleep each night. All I have to do is take a photo
before bed and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big expense, and in turn logistical thing to figure out, is
what pack to take in order to fit what I want to take with me, which
brings up the question of what I want to take... That's definitely been
on my mind. I'm seeing Gecko tonight (for the first time in years) and I
expect that she'll be pretty insightful about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Friday and Saturday nights I slept on the couch at 4211 Moraga #1.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sunday I slept on Rob's couch.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Monday I slept on the beanbag in my office.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Last night night I slept on Kyung and Kat's spare futon in San Jose
off Oakland and Rock.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Tonight I'm staying with Bernadette in Scott's Valley.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, my stuff is still partly in my car, partly in a storage
unit, and partly in Lauren's place across from 4211. I need to
consolidate that shizz, sucks to have things spread around. I'd almost
rather get rid of the stuff than have it scattered around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been cloudy and raining since Friday, but the sun was up this
morning. Saturday I met up with Rob, Zach and Ben, hadn't seen Z for a
long time. We ate at a place called The Pork Room to spite the swine
flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Rob had me come with him to cover the masturabate-a-thon for
the blog. It was entirely underwhelming and not at all what I'd
expected. It appears we went at one of the least active times, though I
still wouldn't have really wanted to go if it weren't for a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I went out with Donna and Lily for dinner in Chinatown, then
to Matt's (Lily's friend and old roomie) birthday party for a bit, then
back to 4211.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was dull and wet. I went to REI to look at packs and buy some hot
weather shirts that will travel well. Hacked teh linux with Rob late
that night, trying to hook Boxee up to his TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday I went to dinner in San Jose with Reem, Julian and Dana and
caught up a bit. Reem had just gotten back from Dubai. Dana and I talked
about her travel dreams and a little about photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I went to Trials and met Kyung, Kat, the other Kyung, Chris
Bennett, Sadek, Julian and Martin.&lt;/p&gt;

like resuming this introspective personal outlet for my own benefit. I'm
going through some changes in life right now and would like to keep
track of the thoughts that are developing in my mind. The two three main
things that are going on are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;• I'm quitting my job at SugarCRM. My last day is May 29th.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;• I'm going to backpack around SE Asia for two months. I'm leaving on
May 29th to Saigon via Tokyo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;• Oh yeah, and I'm homeless as of 4 days ago. I'm living out of my car
and a storage unit in San Francisco.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooooo, rather than tweet succinct thoughts as they come to my mind I
think I'll speak more completely about what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is going on at this very moment is that I just fried a 750gb hard
disk containing a backup of the iMac I had been using before I was
homeless. Little things like this are preparing me for the potential
pitfalls I may encounter on my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
