		<p>Today is Memorial Day and it will be the most memorable for me because
as of today my brother is now out of Iraq forever! He's finishing his
second tour and is now officially out of Iraq, waiting only one day in
Kuwait before returning to Germany. So so so stoked about that.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3562795467/"><img alt="Stow Lake paddleboats" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2425/3562795467_c670324924_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> Yesterday I didn't get to go geocaching with
Lisa, she forgot it was her last day at work and had to work until 7, so
Donna and I went without her. We went to <a class="reference external" href="https://flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/goldengatepark">Golden Gate
Park</a> with
the intent of finding <a class="reference external" href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/faq.aspx">travel
bugs</a> for me to take to
Asia. We went to two lakes and a waterfall on an island before heading
back to the car with a travel bug and a geocoin. Afterwards we went
downtown and wandered around taking photos.</p>
<p>As we were walking down Mission near 5th, a photo in a gallery window
caught my eye and we went in to see it. It actually didn't look like a
photo at all, more like a painting, but ended up being a photo printed
on canvas which made it look more like a painting. We talked to a man
working in the gallery and he told us that the photographer, <a class="reference external" href="http://summit-photo.com">Patrick
Davis</a>, teaches photography at San Jose
State. When I told him we had to go he invited us to come back and drink
wine or coffee and look around the gallery any time we wanted to.</p>
<p>We crossed Mission and went to visit Lisa at work. That was great, I
hadn't seen her in what seems like ages but is probably only a few
weeks. Donna and I got coffee and chatted with Lisa a bit, but she was
busy working so we let her be and went back outside. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3563631378/"><img alt="Napping in the park" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3568/3563631378_c759646682_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>The weather was still really bleak and we were both tired from
walking so much so we went and took a nap in Yerba Buena Garden. I
nabbed another geocache real quick, but there were no trackables in it.
A while later we got up, walked by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/zeum-carousel-san-francisco">Zeum
Carousel</a> and
ended up wandering around SOMA for a while trying to find where we'd
parked the car, taking more pictures down random alleys where we found
several hidden bars and restaurants next to smashed car windows and
empty graffitied lots fenced off with chain link.</p>
<p>We eventually found the car. On the way home it was still overcast and
we were still tired, but the day had been good. We listened to Claude
Debussy. His music has a way of making melancholy wonderful, so it was a
nice compliment to the wonderful day Donna and I made despite the
melancholy weather. In the Sunset district of San Francisco it's common
for people to leave unwanted things on the street for other people to
pick up, and Donna spotted a beautiful, dark wooden dresser carved and
colored with birds and branches. Piano melodies poured out of the
passenger door into the greyness as we tried to fit this piece of
furniture among the belongings I was already been carrying with me. We
fit it in the trunk and took it the one block back to 4211, our final
treasure found that day.</p>
<p>Back at her home we geeked out and I nearly broke my head trying to
figure out some some Wordpress plugin stuff before realizing I was
trying way too hard. Wordpress is pretty awesome. I helped Lauren move
some of her stuff across the street to her new apartment then drifted
off sipping on wine listening to the music Donna had on while she played
online scrabble with her friend in Chicago.</p>
