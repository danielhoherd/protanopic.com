		<p>Thursday I woke up in pain from the events of the previous day. My foot
was definitely bruised in a few places and the cut was dry. My sandals
are pretty soft though and did a great job of easing the pain.</p>
<p>Back at the market for breakfast Tien and I discussed plans to go to Can
Tho, a city located a few hours south by motorbike and home to a famous
floating market on the river, and to Nha Trang. We decided to go to Can
Tho that evening and Nha Trang that weekend or so.</p>
<p>Thu came around with some mangos and a durian. The durian looked like
some kind of organ inside, an alien brain dreamed up by H R Giger. They
made me try the durian, otherwise known around the western world as
&quot;stinky fruit.&quot; it was very strange with several successive flavors and
a distinct after taste that unfortunately lasts for hours even when
chased with a fresh mango.</p>
<p>That afternoon I rained on and off, sometimes very hard, and Mai
suggested that we not go to Can Tho that night. We did though, waiting
for what looked like clear skies and a bit later than we wanted.</p>
<p>The roads were worse than I expected. Tien had said it would take three
hours when I said it would probably take two. She was right though, of
course, because she lived there briefly while taking classes at the
local college. The sunset was gorgeous with big billowing clouds in the
far distance. Darkness set in about halfway there, but it didn't rain.</p>
<p>We passed through a lot of construction, of course. There was a large
building that looked finished with a balcony on the second floor that
stuck out over the entryway. The third floor stuck out above the inside
of the balcony, shading it from the elements and there were no doors
between the balcony and the inside. Vietnam is the kind of place where
it's never so cold you have to turn on a heater. The floors are made
from tile and withstand the elements and human abuse, so you don't
always need windows.</p>
<p>The ride seemed to stretch on forever and my ass began to hurt badly.
Later I would discover bruises back there on the bones and tissue, and
would then decide never to take a long trip on Tien's motorbike ever
again.</p>
<p>As we got to Can Tho I noticed two things that set it apart from other
places we'd been. First, there were numerous Christian churches, which
is very rare in Vietnam. Usually there will be one church and buddhist
shrines and temples everywhere. This was probably the first time I'd
seen several in a row and it was reminiscent of the USA and it's
competitive divisions of Christianity. The other thing I noticed was
more progressive fashion that seemed to have a purpose or theme outside
the normal engrish phrases. There was a sense of brand style in some of
the shops rather than the free for all found most of the other places
I've been. The only other place I'd really seen this in Vietnam was the
westernized shops in Saigon that were sometimes even owned by the brand,
like Dr. Marten's.</p>
<p>We rode down main street and turned off a few side roads searching for a
hotel. By this time Tien was doing most of the searching and I was busy
trying to find an unbruised part of my back side to sit on. Eventually
we found a hotel for $15 and took it. We went upstairs with the
intention of resting for a while before heading back out to a place Tien
used to eat, but we didn't make it back out until the next morning.</p>
