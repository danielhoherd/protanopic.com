		<p>Saturday morning I woke up to Tien climbing back into bed. “I have some
bad news from the people in my village...&quot; She went on to tell me that
the father of her best friend Trinh, whose family lives across the
street, was on his way back from taking his parents to the airport when
he had a heart attack. Trinh and her boyfriend rushed him to the
hospital where they diagnosed him as immediately needing an operation.
It was an expensive operation and Trinh did not have the money, but they
would not do the operation until they had the money. Trinh and her
boyfriend rushed off to the bank to get the money that was needed, but
by the time they returned to the hospital her father was dead.</p>
<p>Tien said he was a good man. Good to his family, good to the people in
the village. I had met his wife, she is a wonderful woman. He had
planned to take her to a tailor to get new clothes made so they could
attend the engagement party for Tien and I. This family was close to
Tien's family.</p>
<p>Trinh and her boyfriend were on their way back from the hospital with
her father's body. When Tien and I headed in to Long Xuyen to take care
of some engagement stuff they had just arrived at the house and were
preparing a memorial.</p>
<p>Later in the day Tien and I went over to their house. Trinh's father was
laying on the bed under a blanket, a flower in his mouth, his wife at
his side fanning the flies off of his body. A table was at the end of
the bed with a photo and a little shrine with many sticks of incense and
cigarettes burning in his honor.</p>
<p>I had never met Trinh, and this was hardly a good time for
introductions, so I ended up not even talking to her. Her boyfriend was
nice though, he was taking care of most of the folks who were coming in
to pay their respects. Tien spent a lot of time with Trinh while I sat
at the side of the room and took in the gravity of the situation. I
partly wanted to photograph the scene, but didn't want to actually go
through with doing it. The photographs would've been amazing though
because of the genuine sorrow. It was bittersweet. Clearly these people
loved this man, but now he was gone.</p>
<p>I gave my regards to Trinh's mother and then Tien and I went back to her
house. We talked about how unfair it is that sometimes money rules who
gets to live and who has to die. It's interesting that this sort of
thing happens in a communist country. We talked about the health of
people in Vietnam and how they handle medical problems. She says that
people do not go to the doctor, they just take medicine to alleviate
their symptoms, and if the symptoms don't go away then they go to the
doctor. She said that they do a bunch of things that probably don't help
serious problems.</p>
<p>The world is really different over here in Vietnam. So much is the same,
but so much is different...</p>
