		<p>Wednesday morning I slept through my alarm and the noise of the other
people in the house and didn't get up until after 9, which never
happens. Shortly after I got up the power went out, which is now pretty
normal. Tien and I decided to head into Long Xuyen to get breakfast and
return my suit.</p>
<p>Breakfast was notable because it was a pretty miserable experience. Tien
took me to a new place to try a new food. Before we even got our food I
was having respiratory problems from the fumes of passing scooters. When
breakfast came it wasn't very appetizing to loom at, and the flavor
wasn't exactly desirable to my taste buds. The thing that finally made
me a little nauseous though was one of the most disgusting dogs I've
ever seen that came wandering by. Black nipples dangled inches below the
low hanging skin of the bitches belly and sores adorned her backside as
she miserably waddled past looking for food. Tien asked me &quot;is it
terrible?&quot; &quot;yeah...&quot; she just laughed, apologized and said that it was
her favorite thing to eat for breakfast.</p>
<p>Things got better at our usual coffee shop near the lake where we got
lost in the Internet looking at Stereoscopic images online. I found the
Loreo 3d lens in a cap and decided I wanted to buy one if I ever found
one. We headed out to look for a camera shop and helmet shops, but
didn't really find anything good. We headed home and on the way I wished
I had a smaller camera to use for times like when I'm on the back of the
scooter, or when the d300 was too large to bring along, or when I want
to take video. I decided I really need a second camera.</p>
<p>Thursday was yet another rainy day. Tien and I spent a usual amount of
time trying to figure out our future, this time discussing the option of
me going back to America at the end of July and having her come later
once the visa is approved. This option sucks, but may be the right way
to do it... I wasn't happy with that thought because I never wanted
another long distance relationship, and I definitely didn't want to be a
married couple who live in separate countries. The frustration with this
combined with the rain made me very tired and I slept for most of the
day.</p>
<p>That evening after it got dark the rain finally let up so Tien, her
sisters and I went into town just to get out for a while. We went to the
supermarket and I finally found the Da Lat wine I've been looking for,
so I bought a bottle. It was a little tart, but I enjoyed it. What can I
say? I love wine.</p>
<p>Friday was another interesting breakfast. Tien and her mom try to make
me new things to eat, but sometimes they attempt to recreate the type of
meal I'd have in America. This morning was eggs, bread, butter, coffee,
uncooked hot dogs and pig liver pate with soy sauce. I really do
appreciate their effort to show me new things, but I had to tell Tien
that coffee and bread with eggs and soy sauce was good enough. Uncooked
hot dogs and pig liver pate have no place in an american breakfast.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Tien's uncle from Saigon showed up in his Toyota tercel.
He was on his way through to drop somebody off and was headed back to
Saigon that day. Tien and I had been planning to go there for a day and
then fly to Malaysia, and this was the perfect chance to go, plus we
wouldn't have to ride in a bus. I was certainly ready to get back on the
road since I was setting a new record for consecutive days spent in Binh
Hoa, so we packed up and waited for him to come back.</p>
<p>So we waited... And waited. We had thought he would be back in an hour,
but he wasn't. I played iPhone video games to kill time. Then I let Ngoc
play some. I taught her how to play field runners while we ate lunch and
she did better than I expected on her second try.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We finally left Binh Hoa at 2pm in the cool comfort of a private car,
a rare pleasure in Vietnam. Her uncle ended up being one of those
stick shift drivers who doesn't use the friction zone so my
equilibrium was a bit off, but it was still better than the bus.</div>
<div class="line">I saw a person at the side of the road with a sewing machine ready to
do alterations and repairs.</div>
</div>
<p>Tien's cousins house was on the way so we stopped by for a while. It was
a nice house across a wooden footbridge from one lane sub street off the
main street. Some men were in the water building the foundation for a
wider cement bridge that would be safer for the villagers.</p>
<p>We went inside and sat a while, eating corn on the cob and rambutan. I
went into a back room and laid down in a hammock and enjoyed how quiet
it was in this place. Quiet was something I had been longing fir since
it seems like there is noise everywhere in Binh Hoa even though it's in
the country.</p>
<p>It began to rain. The rain was loud in the tin roof of the wooden
extension o the house. I really liked that place... The wood was dark
and welcoming and the vaulted ceilings made the space feel larger than
most Vietnamese buildings which have flat ceilings.</p>
<p>The rain got heavier, then the power went out, then we left.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people out on scooters despite the rain. They all
wear and share rain ponchos. I saw a man with an ATI Radeon poncho. This
was not because he worked for ATI or owned a Radeon card or probably
even a personal computer. He probably got it from someone at the factory
where it was made. Just like everything else brand name, it's not for
fashion or endorsement, it's what's available.</p>
<p>The skies outside were smooth grey and for some reason it reminded me of
Littleton. The journey was now a familiar one and I usually knew what to
expect to see ahead.</p>
<p>Tien and I shared my iPod because I finally got a headphone Y splitter
that worked correctly. It was nice and I even was able to hear new
things, like how Kaskade's song Mccamon uses the sampled record noise to
make a beat.</p>
<p>We stopped for dinner and I ordered beef, but somehow ended up with
seafood. This tends to happen. I most certainly never order seafood but
somehow I end up with it. Oh well...</p>
<p>Back on the road I looked out into the dark night and imagined that I
was somewhere else. I used to do this as a kid on the way to Texas. Dark
roads are hardly distinguishable so you could just as well be anywhere
else in the world. I thought about the trip ahead, going to Malaysia,
just Tien and I. The car stereo was trying to drown out the music from
my iPod and I wondered what could be less sexy than Vietnamese talk
radio.</p>
<p>We were dropped off at the same house I came to my first night in Saigon
and ended up at the same hotel I was staying at when I proposed to Tien.
Saigon might actually be starting to feel like home.</p>
