		<p>Friday I woke up sick as a dog in Rob's place. I had full on flu
symptoms on top of the ongoing digestive problems and was not a happy
camper. I slept well though, amazingly. I took a shower and played
online a little while Rob kept sleeping. I decided to look up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/qa.htm">H1N1
symptoms</a> and saw that I had most
of them, so I thought I should take this more seriously just in case. I
left Rob sleeping and went to find breakfast and medicine. I loaded up
on NyQuil, ate a banana and drank some Odwalla Mo'Beta.</p>
<p>I noticed I was near Brianna's house so I went over there. There was an
older Asian lady in the entryway where I thought Brianna's new place
was, and I thought I might have the wrong street. I got out my phone and
it signed onto her wireless network so I knew I was in the right place.
I don't have cell phone service in the USA yet, but I used Skype on my
iPhone to call Brianna. She said she was at work and wouldn't get off
for many hours.</p>
<p>I was feeling ill and was getting tired so I parked my car on a quiet
street and went to sleep. The sun came out so I drove to Golden Gate
park and found a shady area under a tree near a public restroom and
slept for several more hours.</p>
<p>I headed back to Brianna's place around 5pm. Shortly after I got there
she showed up with a big smile and gave me a big hug. We went inside and
she made me some green tea and a snack while we talked about what had
happened in the two months that I was gone. Her new house was really
cool. She shares it with Lily and Terresina, but they weren't home.</p>
<p>Lauren called and then came over. She had just recently gotten back from
a three week trip to Australia. We caught up a bit while Brianna talked
to some boys on the phone and then showered. Terresina showed up around
9pm. She had two new tattoos and a heavy gold chain around her neck.</p>
<p>One of Brianna's boyfriends came over with a bottle of tequila and
Terresina and Brianna made dinner for all of us. We listened to Corinne
Bailey Rae and talked and drank and and a good old time reminiscent of
dinners at 4211. The three of them went out to party in Mission and I
stayed home on the couch to sleep off my illness, the medicine in full
effect and doing its job of alleviating symptoms. In a new apartment but
on the same old couch I hoped to get a good night's sleep.</p>
