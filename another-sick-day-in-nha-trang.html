		<p>On the morning of November 19th I was just as sick as I had been the
previous day, and my throat hurt just a little bit worse. We spent the
morning laying around surfing the internet and being generally lazy. The
weather was still a little stormy too, pretty much exactly as it had
been the previous day. We had pho for breakfast at the same place we'd
gone the previous night, and would continue eating there almost
exclusively for the remainder of our stay in Nha Trang.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">After breakfast we decided to take a walk down the beach to get some
fresh air and some sun. Tien was trying to convince me that mid-day
sunlight was terrible for you whereas morning and evening sunlight was
good for you. I tried to explain that sunlight is both good and bad
for you, depending on how much of it you get. I'm not really an
authority in that area though, so I suppose I could've been wrong, but
I'd never heard anything leading me to conclude that mid-</div>
<div class="line">day sun was worse.</div>
</div>
<p>We walked down the beach the opposite direction and found a bunch of
wooden beach chairs under little wooden huts. We sat at one but were
quickly told that it cost 100k for a day to rent one, so we kept
walking. It began to rain lightly but with heavy wind, so we retreated
to a nearby gazebo where other people were doing the same. We sat there
for a while and the weather didn't relent, but luckily a woman came
wandering by trying to sell fruits. We somehow managed to get into an
argument about what fruits we were going to buy, I guess she thought we
could eat a whole pineapple along with 3 mangoes and countless other
fruits. Sometime I'm amazed at how easy it is for Vietnamese people to
make each other feel guilty for breaking agreements that were never even
made. In the end we got a good selection of fruit for a decent price, if
only because I had the money and I wasn't going to buy shit if she kept
trying to sell me fruit I didn't want.</p>
<p>As we were sitting in the gazebo eating our fruit, another woman came by
trying to sell us cigarettes and all sorts of other things we didn't
want. She was persistent and stayed there a while. All of the sudden a
huge terrible breaking sound came from behind us. We turned around to
see a large coconut rolling across the grass away from large pieces of
broken tile. I would later learn that coconut injuries are more common
in Vietnam than auto injuries.</p>
<p>I was beginning to get fatigued again, and really irritated that I had
gotten sick in Nha Trang since we'd been waiting so long to get there.
We headed back to the hotel and laid around all day as I gobbled up
medicine and we both geeked out on the ever frustrating and intermittent
wifi we leeched from the hotel next door.</p>
<p>Having read a few articles in The Onion about National Awareness Month
and an article making fun of a man for defending what he believed the
constitution to be, I realized that I was pretty ignorant of what the
constitution really said and really a lot of other things that I'd grown
up believing that I had yet to verify. Generally I felt a lot like the
ignorant, misinformed people that irked me in political and religious
arguments. With nothing to do in the middle of the night, I decided to
go ahead and read the constitution. I didn't get very far into it
because I kept getting side-tracked reading context and related
information, but I must say that I did learn a lot and it was incredibly
eye-opening.</p>
<p>We got some dinner and slept away the night, and I was still frustrated
about being sick, hoping I'd be well the next day so Tien and I could
enjoy our vacation.</p>
