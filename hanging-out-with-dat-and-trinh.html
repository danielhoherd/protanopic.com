		<p>On Sunday, my first morning back in Vietnam, Tien and I went to our old
breakfast place. It was OK, but honestly it's lost its sentimental value
with the realization that it's not that great of a restaurant. It is
very convenient though. After breakfast we went back to the hotel room
and did some online stuff and fell asleep for a long, long time.</p>
<p>When we woke up, Tien's friend Trinh and her boyfriend Dat were on their
way to visit us with a couple of motorbikes. Tien and I hadn't eaten
dinner yet so when they arrived we went out to find some food. We'd
planned on getting pho, but Tien forgot about that and we ended up going
to KFC. I was amused by this, expecting their menu to have interesting
variations not available in America, but I didn't see anything that was
out of the ordinary. I quizzed Tien on what KFC meant and who that guy
was, and she had absolutely no idea. Not much of a surprise there from a
girl who didn't know McDonalds or Starbucks until she went to Malaysia,
and this is one of the things I love about her.</p>
<p>After dinner we headed out into the night traffic and instantly got
separated from Dat and Trinh. Saigon traffic can be pretty crazy and
Tien isn't used to the big city so she isn't assertive in her
motorbiking. This later lead to us putting more effort into figuring out
how to get me a motorbike license in VN. The four of us on two bikes
cruised around the city a little bit in rain amounts varying between
none and pouring, but it was warm so it wasn't all that bad. We did get
drenched though, and decided to just call it a night.</p>
<p>That night I found it very hard to sleep, most likely from how long I'd
slept earlier that day.</p>
<p>Monday morning we woke up and tried to find a place different from the
usual place we eat breakfast, but couldn't find anything before our
hunger took priority and we went back there. On our walk we saw a minor
motorbike crash. I haven't seen many traffic accidents here, and none
have been bad since people tend to go pretty slowly, but this was the
first of two that I saw that day.</p>
<p>Trinh and Dat came back to the hotel and we four headed out to a park
where Trinh liked to go a lot when she still had free time, Bình Quoí 1.
It was labeled as a tourist park, but was essentially a portrait
photographers playground. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4049362522/"><img alt="TT at the falls" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4049362522_0fb6a00800_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>There were barely any
tourists there, but what there were plenty of was beautiful girls
dressed to the 9's posing in front of cameras. There were also several
couples who were getting their engagement photos taken by professional
photography crews, complete with off-cam lighting, props and makeup
artists. The park was laid out with paths leading past backdrop after
backdrop. A waterfall, a cart, a cyclo, a ruined brick wall, a ruined
wall with pillars, a stone with flowers next to a pond, a bench on a
lawn, a bamboo swing, a barrel and ladle, a causeway across a pond, a
canoe in the pond, water lilies, flowers growing in vines up trees,
stone statues, so on and so forth. This made it easy for photographers
to play musical backdrops with each other, shuffling from one to the
next to put their respective couples into the various scenes. Honestly
it was pretty brilliant, and it didn't cost anything for us to get in
either. I assume they made their money off charging professional crews
and selling food and water at the eateries that were scattered
throughout the campus.</p>
<p>The four of us spent an hour or so walking around and taking
photographs, then headed back towards downtown. We stopped on the way
back and I got some absolutely terrible spaghetti carbonara while Tien
enjoyed delicious Vietnamese food. I resolved not to buy anything too
culinarily distant from VN food from now on.</p>
<p>On the way home I saw a blind beggar holding a cane and a hat with his
eyes rolled back in his head kneeling at the side of the road where
hundreds of motorbikes were passing by.</p>
<p>Back near the hotel Tien and I tried to find a pharmacy for my malaria
meds but couldn't find anything. We resolved to find it later and went
back inside to take a rest. I fell asleep and didn't wake up for several
hours. My sleeping schedule still hadn't adjusted yet and it was taking
a toll on my daylight hours and my energy.</p>
<p>We went briefly out with Dat and Trinh again to grab some dinner, then
they headed home while Tien and I retired to the old Ruby Star.</p>
