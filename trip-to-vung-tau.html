		<p>My layover between Vientiane and Saigon was Phnom Penh. I thought this
would be great because I could call Tien using my Cambodian SIM card and
let her know that my flight was an hour late, but she didn't pick up. We
were on the ground for about 15 minutes, then I boarded the same
airplane in the same seat and we flew away.</p>
<p>Along with arrival and departure cards for passport control, the spread
of H1N1 has prompted governments to require incoming visitors to fill
out questionnaires about the state of their health. Previously the
questions had been something like &quot;Have you had dizziness, cough,
diarrhea, fever, nausea within the last 10 days? What countries have you
visited in the last 10 days?&quot;</p>
<p>The Ho Chi Minh airport has had the most outbreaks of H1N1 that I've
heard of yet which explains their additional diligence. &quot;Have you come
in contact with anybody who has had fever, cough, diarrhea, nausea
within the last 15 days.&quot; I couldn't even remember everywhere I'd slept
in the last 15 days.</p>
<p>I managed to find the slowest line at passport control. This is
something I have a real knack for. I also had done this in Thailand when
I was trying to catch a flight that was already boarding and in Laos
with the whole pen incident.</p>
<p>As I was walking outside I felt distinctly different from the last few
times I was in Saigon and I thought about how much I'd done in the past
few weeks that had given me a new confidence in international travel.</p>
<p>As I walked outside Tien was waiting for me in a black blouse and a
white skirt, looking beautiful and beaming with joy. I never quite know
how I'm supposed to express my feelings within cultural affection
allowances, but I managed to find something that was acceptable to show
my joy at having her back. She grabbed her sister Mai, who I was not
expecting to see, and we went off to find a taxi.</p>
<p>This was where my travel experience came in handy. I cut through the
timidness that Tien has, kicked the first taxi driver to the curb and
found a ride to the hydrofoil station at a quarter the cost. This is
what you learn from getting ripped off at the Saigon airport. &quot;Fool me
once, shame on ... shame on you. If you fool me... We can't get fooled
again.&quot;</p>
<p>We got to the hydrofoil station and I was quickly reminded how utterly
chaotic Saigon traffic is. Smoggy, loud, and chaotic. What sense is
there in calmly walking across a six lane river of continuously flowing
traffic?</p>
<p>We bought our hydrofoil tickets for the Vina Express to Vũng Tàu, but it
wasn't leaving for over two hours, so we found a place to sit and wait
while drinking coffee and eating some noodles. Then it began to rain.
Then it began to pour. Then we realized that we would miss the glorious
sunset we'd hoped to see from the hydrofoil just as we were to arrive in
Vũng Tàu.</p>
<p>The hydrofoil was awesome and pretty freakin quick. It skimmed over the
water and made big splashes up onto the window. It was also very agile
in the water, so agile that sometimes we thought it'd tip over, but it
skimmed by tug boats and ferries and barges and oil rigs down the Saigon
River and off into the pacific ocean. A girl came by and told us that
because of the weather there were oceanic problems at the port so we'd
have to go to a different port and take a bus into town. This frustrated
us beyond the mere absence of a sunset, but that's how travel goes in
these places. There was also the standard TV display of random
entertainment and most of what we saw was some weird kung fu movie with
four people who would wring out a shirt and drink water from it, then
use it as a weapon.</p>
<p>Right at dusk we pulled up near a dock in an industrial area a little
ways up a calm river just south of Vũng Tàu. It was still gently raining
as they made us climb over 3 ships with no planks between them while
carrying our bags to get to the actual dock. Tien was still wearing her
nice clothes but we managed to cross with few issues. She admitted that
she'd dressed poorly for traveling because she wanted to look nice for
my return and this was fine by me.</p>
<p>Some of us managed to pile into a bus and fill it completely up while
others remained outside in the rain haggling with taxi drivers. Soon it
was completely dark, the rain had returned to a pour and we were stuck
on a one lane dirt road behind a car that had no driver. I was reminded
of those idiots in SF who double park on the train tracks and lock their
car then disappear inside of a building. One time I sat on a train for
30 minutes while they towed the car. This time it only lasted 5 minutes
though, which was nice because traveling can really wear you out and I'd
been traveling all day and had already been off schedule twice.</p>
<p>We arrived at the bus drop off and stood under an awning at the local
KFC while people tried to figure out where they were going to stay, then
tried to find taxis to take them there. It's interesting having people
who speak the language with you because they can actually get useful
information, but this information is rarely passed on to you. I kept
flipping back and forth between &quot;let me handle this&quot; mode and &quot;you
handle this&quot; mode. In the end Mai found us a place next door to the
house of a girl who was trying to find a taxi, so the four of us got in
the taxi and headed off. It appeared to be nowhere near the beach by the
time we got there on the back streets, but in fact ended up being only
two blocks from the beach. We dropped our stuff in the room, took a
little rest and went off to find dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner we walked down to the beach. It was great to finally be
there... aside from the fact that the waves on the shore were lined with
trash, it was beautiful. With Tien on my back we waded about 50 feet out
into the warm water and stood there watching the lightning storm that
was going on way out in the Eastern Pacific. It felt great to be back at
the ocean. I had been by the ocean for the previous year and a half
while living in San Francisco, but in the previous two months I was away
from it and it was great to have it back. Even more, it was great to be
in warm water as opposed to the cold SF Pacific, and it was great to
have my girl with me to experience the lightning show, which was
reminiscent. It was, I guess, a mix between old good memories and new
joys.</p>
<p>The following day we got breakfast and then headed out to a large
Christian monument on top of a hill just south of the strip where we
were staying. This was the first real Christian anything I'd seen on my
trip. There wasn't a word of english or french on any of the plaques so
I have no idea what it was about, but there were angels and moses and
cupids and at the top of the walkway up the hill, a huge statue of Jesus
with his arms outstretched.</p>
<p>By the top of the hill I was drenched in sweat. I sat with Tien and
talked about some of the hardships we faced in getting married and
bringing her back to the USA. There are a few big hurdles to pass this
month and I wanted to make sure she was still with me on all of our
plans. She was, so we were happy. Her sister arrived with a bag of fruit
after we'd been there a while, so the three of us sat and ate lychee and
rambutan. We stayed at the top for a while, then headed back down the
hill and off to the hotel.</p>
<p>Our plan was to clean up and go swimming, but the climb up the hill and
the heat of the day had wiped us out, so we ended up falling asleep for
an hour or two. This was fine though, we needed it, and afterwards we
headed down to the beach. We found three chairs to rent and Mai stayed
to watch our things while Tien and I ran off to go play in the water. As
it turns out, swimming is not one of the things that is taught in
Vietnamese school. Later I had a good conversation with Tien about the
differences between an average first world education and an average
third world education. The fact that Vietnam is about halfway covered
with water yet they don't teach swimming blew my mind. Tien said that 15
students had died the previous year from drowning while riding a boat to
school in heavy rains.</p>
<p>This lack of swimming education made Tien terribly frightened by the
waves and it took me a while to chase her through the water and coax her
out past the breakers to where the water was more calm. Unfortunately
she couldn't always touch the ground out there. She had seen a photo I
took in Ha Long Bay of a boy floating on his back and wondered how he
could do that, so I taught her how and in typical Tien style, she
learned very quickly. In 15 minutes she was floating on her own as large
waves that were on their way to breaking passed her by. We ended the
swim lesson, took a few minutes to enjoy the water and the fact that we
were finally traveling together, then headed back to the shore to let
Mai have her turn in the water.</p>
<p>There were women walking around with eggs and fish and baskets
containing metal cans with fire that was boiling water where they would
cook you fresh seafood. Many women were walking around with baskets of
fresh fruit, and some guy was riding his bicycle by with a huge speaker
system on it that made me think of the pillow fight in SF this year. A
few people rode down the beach on their scooters. A group of kids next
to us had collected a few dozen shells with crabs inside of them and as
we were leaving one of the crabs tried to walk its way off the table. A
man nearby picked it up before it got off the table and showed it to the
group of friends he was sitting with.</p>
<p>Mai, Tien and I headed back to the hotel. The path to the beach is a
typical Vietnamese path, which means it is free to ride scooters on and
do whatever else you feel like doing on. Some kids were parked on their
scooter talking on the phone. One woman was cooking up some weird fish
that looked like a flat octopus.</p>
<p>The next day was Monday, but still Sunday in the USA which means I still
had time to post my weekly photo set, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dreamnotoftoday.com/?p=2989">The
(d)SPOT</a>. Because there was
an elevator shaft between our room and the AP, I had to sit in the hall
next to the elevator to do my work. I caught up with some co-workers and
did other assorted online stuff as I was posting my photos. Just as I
was finishing up and saying goodbye to some folks, the power went out.
At first I thought the AC had just gone off, but then my internet
connection was interrupted. I finally verified that it was indeed the
power being out by checking the elevator, which was nonfunctional. I
thought about how awful it would be to be trapped in an elevator in a
small hotel in a third world country and was thankful that I was not.</p>
