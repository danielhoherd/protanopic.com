		<p>Sunday morning in Binh Hoa village, the plans to go to the beach fell
through two different ways due to cultural customs. That stuff sure can
get in the way... That's OK though, one more relaxing day in Binh Hoa
will be fine.<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3601906139/"><img alt="Tien and Ngoc" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3601906139_06099febe7_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon was relaxing and wonderful. Nearly heaven, nearly
zen. I was laying in the hammock in the kitchen where Tien's brother and
his wife share a double bed in a corner with their two daughters. No
sink, no oven, no refrigerator. The same spot where each night the
family members sit on the tile floor and eat their meals, happy as can
be. I was watching Tien's figure through the hammock webbing as she
washed dishes in a tub under the tin roof of the back patio, the same
place this family washes their clothes and hangs them to dry. They same
place they wash their children. I was listening to Debussy on my iPhone,
Arabesque No. 1 and some other stuff from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_Lily_Chou-Chou">All About Lily
Chou-chou</a>,
the leaves of tropical trees blowing in the blue sky outside the back
door, a gecko crawling down the inside wall, a warm breeze blowing over
my body. I was charmed by this place, by its people and their good
lives.</p>
<p>I don't wish I could've photographed this because it's the kind of thing
you just can't photograph. Maybe a film could've captured it...</p>
<p>Tien came inside and sat with me. She's very sad that I'm leaving, and
she said some preemptive goodbyes, expressed some happiness and sorrow.
It was a very bittersweet moment that lasted quite some time as we sat,
talked, found small ways to show affection for each other, enjoying the
physical company that has been missing for the last 8 years of our
friendship.</p>
<p>She was wearing a really cute engrish shirt. Cartoonish line drawings of
a face and some characters. &quot;Beloved he has maded by yours truly love.&quot;</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3599203845/"><img alt="A Temple in Binh Hoa" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3599203845_72cfb0da02_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> Later that night we went out on a scooter ride to
see the sunset and to go to the bank to get money that would not be
needed. Tien and I planned to take her whole family to the beach as a
way for me to show my appreciation for their hospitality, but when we
got back home her mother would not have it because of the cost. She felt
guilty for Tien and I spending too much money on it. Tien was very sad
about this, and I was disappointed but understanding. I don't know how
else to show my gratitude. I've been trying to come up with something
more original than simple monetary compensation, but have come up
fruitless in such an alien society. Plus, what do you buy for somebody
who owns 3 of about 10 local shops?</p>
