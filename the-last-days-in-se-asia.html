		<p>I woke up to an oncoming silence created by the absence of electrical
power on Tuesday morning. This was a good way to get an early start
because I couldn't sleep without the fan protecting me from the
mosquitoes and cooling my body. I took a shower and headed out for
breakfast with Tien. We went to a new place that is near the internet
cafe we frequent, right next to the lake by the river in Long Xuyen.</p>
<p>At breakfast Tien told me that she'd talked to the principle of the
school where she works and he had reminded her that she had employment
obligations that last through September. This meant that she couldn't
travel with me because she would have to resume teaching in less than a
week. We had planned on either moving to Saigon to work or more
preferably to travel a bit, probably back from Bankok down through
Malaysia where we could see all those beautiful beaches that we missed
out on last time. Now this was not going to happen because Tien would be
busy. The only reasonable option for me was to return to America on my
scheduled flight which left the next night. Even though this was an
option that I never wanted to have to pick, it felt nice to finally have
a final word on what would happen.</p>
<p>When we got home there was still no power. We decided to go to Saigon
that day and stay over night. Tien got on the phone and found us a bus
leaving at 4pm while her mom and sister fixed some food for us. Tien
told me a story about being attacked by a wild dog near her house when
she was in Jr. High. She was outside playing with her puppy and some
crazy wild dog ran up and started to attack her and her puppy, so she
picked up the puppy and ran but the dog chased them. Some local folks
saw what was happening, found some bamboo sticks and killed the wild
dog. At the end of this story we realized we didn't have enough time to
catch the 4pm, so we shot for the 5pm and began packing.</p>
<p>Tien and I went to the market to get some gifts for my family and
friends. Her family kept wanting me to take more and more stuff, not
realizing the restrictions that come with living your life out of a
backpack. I simply couldn't take a lot of what they wanted to give me
because I didn't have the room and I was already heavy laden. On top of
that, the food and liquid restrictions are so tight these days that you
can't really take either of those products. That was a shame, I was
hoping to bring back that bottle of CK Entirety.</p>
<p>I said my goodbyes to the family that had so graciously taken me in two
months ago, feeding me and clothing me and giving me all that they could
to make me comfortable, and had then become my own family. Saying
goodbye is hard when you don't speak their language though. How do you
convey the details of the small things you really appreciated? I did my
best and then four of us got on two scooters and headed to the Long
Xuyen bus station. I had a new energy, the energy that comes with having
a plan and putting it in motion. I was happy to be doing anything, and
more so happy to be on my way back to the USA where my family and
friends were waiting, my car was waiting, and I still had the freedom of
unemployment. I was so caught up in thinking about how great it would be
that I forgot that Tien wasn't coming with me, and when I remembered
this my heart sank a bit and something felt not right. There was nothing
I could do about it though.</p>
<p>It was harvest time in her village and I saw a man on a cart pulled by
two water buffalo heading off through the waters of a tracked up rice
paddy. Many people were out moving big bags of rice from vehicle to
larger vehicle.</p>
<p>Back on the bus to Saigon for the last time of my trip, I thought about
how I'd be traveling in a few days in my own car with my GPS guiding my
way, 80mph across the open highways of western America. That style of
travel is so different from the way people travel in Vietnam and I was
really grateful for the American ways that I had taken for granted. The
automobile and the highway truly were and are avenues of freedom and an
opportunity that millions of people do not have.</p>
<p>I put on the Samurai Champloo soundtrack and kept thinking about my old
familiar ways, the joys that I had given up when I left America. I was
really looking forward to getting back. I had a sore throat though and
my stomach was still a little upset. Tien was on my arm, visibly upset
but not falling apart, just looking up with those worried eyes that she
gets when something is not right.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the bus station most of the ground was under about 1
foot of standing water. We once again found a taxi to take us to ye olde
Ruby Star where I got a larger room than usual, complete with a bath
tub. I got a beer, drew a bath, and relaxed. Then I got online and began
pinging a bunch of people in America and planning what I'd do when I
touched down. That night I slept deeply.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning we woke up to the sounds of big engines, small
engines, and honking. Our larger room came complete with a double window
that was partly broken and created a hole where the sounds of Saigon
could assault our sleeping bodies. We did have to get a move on though,
so it was probably for the good. Tien got a phone call from FedEx and
while I was in the shower a courier showed up with some gear from Joby.
They asked to use a photo of mine on their page and sent out some gear
as a thank you. I had planned to use this while I was in Asia, but here
it was arriving hours from my back to America and I now had to pack this
unused gear in my bag with all of the gifts. To top it off, the shipment
came from Santa Cruz California.</p>
<p>We hurried out for breakfast at a usual spot, then came back to the
hotel where I managed to pack most of my things into my backpack. I gave
some of the left-over stuff that I wouldn't need to Tien to take back to
her house. We checked out and left our bags with the hotel
receptionists. We're in pretty good with them since we stay at that
hotel so much, and we trust them, so it was a good alternative to
carrying our bags around in the mid-day Saigon heat.</p>
<p>We headed out to find a book store. Tien had finished the tiny book we'd
bought for her to read and were looking for something significantly more
challenging and intellectual. We asked a cyclo and scooter taxi driver
if there were any bookstores nearby, but they said not for 2 km and
offered to take us there. We declined and found store selling books
about 200 feet away. It was basically a media piracy store. We picked up
1984 and a DVD collection of Tom Cruise movies, a strange dose of
western culture for Tien to digest before she (hopefully) gets to
America in a few months.</p>
<p>We were hot and parched by then so we went to find a coffee shop. We
found a really western style cafe with a bunch of backpackers hunched
over laptops and pay terminals. We sat at the cafe and talked for a
while, tried to figure out what to do with an empty day in Saigon. I
couldn't think of much except shopping but Tien didn't want clothes or
jewelry or shoes or any of that stuff. Instead we went to the store
where I bought my LX3 and looked at laptops. They had a decent
selection, but we weren't really happy with any of them. The Acer
netbook was nice feeling but I didn't trust its quality. Plus, I had
forgotten my wallet back at the hotel so we couldn't buy it outright
anyway.</p>
<p>We ended up grabbing our bags and having a taxi take us to a little
street where there were numerous computer shops. We looked around a bit
and although I was able to find an Asus netbook, it was more than I had
on me. We settled on a Benq Joybook. Interestingly, the one we bought
did not come with Windows but ran a derivative of Fedora 8 called
Linpus. At first I was thinking this would be bad, but on second thought
I decided it could be good. Desktop linux is pretty usable now, and it
would do pretty much everything Tien needed, so I decided to take a
slight risk and get it. Worst case we could load Windows on it later...</p>
<p>There was a cafe nearby called Jazz Cafe where we went to camp out for a
few hours, play with her new laptop and kill some time. They weren't
playing Jazz. The laptop was pretty good, a standard current netbook
with a decent build, light weight and slightly hot. The screen was nice
too. Unfortunately the OS was ... lacking. I decided that rather than
trust some one-off distro of Linux I'd load it up with Ubuntu. That is
something I'm familiar with and could help her with if there were
problems. On top of that, i just happened to have a USB key that had a
bootable Ubuntu 9.04 install on it. How geeky is that? I was worried
that I'd mess something up and not have time to fix it, but 30 minutes
later we were up and running on Ubuntu with no hiccups.</p>
<p>While the OS was installing it finally hit me that I wasn't going to be
with Tien much longer. I explained to her that I have this third person
mode that I go into that detaches me from the emotional effects of the
things I need to do and that I wasn't just unaffected by the pending
geographical separation and time apart. I was worried she'd think I
didn't care, which I did, but I've found in my life that worrying about
inevitabilities is wasteful, even if it seems insincere.</p>
<p>Eventually it was time to go, so we found a taxi to take us to the
airport. There was a TV screen inside the taxi that was playing a video
of people rollerblading down the Great Wall of China. It then turned to
something about Michael Jackson and showed a video morph of what MJ
looked like from when he was young to when he died. I realized that the
King of Pop died a long time ago and all that remained was a plastic
ghost. I wonder if MJ's body has even begun decomposing yet or if it's
still as fresh as a McDonalds french fry.</p>
<p>At the airport Tien's mom and sister Thule met us. I went to check in
for my flight and when I got to the checkin area it looked like
everybody was moving to another country. Everybody in the whole line had
at least 3 suitcases stacked on carts. Some had several boxes. I
couldn't believe all of the luggage this entire group of people had, and
they weren't even together. Luckily a woman motioned me over to some
premium super-duper megastar member high speed lane that I did not
deserve to be in and I checked in for my flight in about 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Tien's family and I found a little cafe area to sit at while we waited
for the last hour before my flight. Tien translated a few things but
mostly we just enjoyed each other's company. Tien and I were trying
magic tricks with a Malaysia .20 piece and I made a syphon out of two
bendy straws to mix Tien's apple juice with my Sprite. I went to use the
bathroom and there were two girls in there, a mother and an attendant.
At first I wondered if I was in the right bathroom, and I was. I thought
about San Francisco and about an Erasure concert I went to, sometimes
there just is no gender separation in the bathroom. Another odd thing
about this bathroom was that one wall was a huge window that looked out
into the parking area, so all of those scooter parking folks could watch
you urinate. This was no different from watching men urinate on the side
of the road everywhere else in Vietnam, so that too wasn't really
uncomfortable. On the way I went to use the hand drier but decided
against it when I saw that people had used it for an ash tray.</p>
<p>Before long it was time to leave Tien and her family. I had already said
goodbye to Tien's mom and sister a few times, so this was just another
goodbye for them, but Tien was in a trance. I thought at first she was
trying to translate some stuff in her mind, but realized that she was
just overwhelmed with emotion. I thought she fell apart when I embraced
her, but she kept herself together. It was only after she was out of
sight that I finally felt the effects of realization that I wouldn't see
her for a long time. Passport control went quickly, there was a short
wait at the gate, and soon I was sound asleep in my seat flying away
from Vietnam.</p>
