		<p>Ten days left until I'm on my way to the airport.</p>
<p>Yesterday my replacement at work started his job. He fell right into
step, so that's good as I don't want to leave my co-workers in a tough
spot with IT support issues.</p>
<p>On my lunch break I had my last dental appointment before my trip.
Nothing special there, but medical things are important to handle before
leaving because not only will I be in some questionable spots as far as
medical support is concerned, I will also not have medical coverage
since I am leaving my job and all of its benefits behind. Goodbye free
dental care. Goodbye $5 immunization shots. Goodbye 401k.<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3092339782/"><img alt="Allison Town" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3104/3092339782_e33698169b_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a></p>
<p>After work I headed up to SF to hang out with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3165305187/">Shannon</a>, but
she was gone by the time I got there. She was in from out of town and
left early for some reason. Such is the nature of the traveler; we have
to enjoy their company when they are present.</p>
<p>I ended up going to dinner with Donna, Lily and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3092339782/">Allison</a> at a
great Italian place near Allison's place up in North Beach,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sodinis-green-valley-restaurant-san-francisco">Sodini's</a>.
I have to say, their lasagna was on par with that of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-stinking-rose-san-francisco">The Stinking
Rose</a>. It
was good to catch up with Allison since she's leaving SF this Friday to
move back to SoCal. When we were done the weather had turned from chilly
to really really cold wind and fog, which is weird since it was 90º on
Sunday. Donna and I headed back to 4211 where
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/brianna">Brianna</a> was
nursing a boil burn on her leg and making some kind of Mexican dinner
with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/terresina">Terresina</a>.
Somehow I drifted off to sleep on the couch, waking up several times
during the night as people came and went, and woke to a foggy, wet Ocean
Beach.</p>
<p>2 miles south in Daly City the fog was so thick you couldn't see more
than 100 feet ahead.</p>
<p>3 miles south in Colma the sun was out and it was warm.</p>
<p>50 miles south in Cupertino I arrived at the office under an overcast
sky. 8 more days of work.</p>
