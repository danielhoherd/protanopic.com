		<p>When I woke up this morning the first thing I noticed was the sound of
songbirds outside, which has so far been absent from my Asian trip.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson had died while I was asleep.</p>
<p>Everybody was gone from the house except Max. I had coffee and a muffin
and caught up with an old friend, Aimee Rich, who I hadn't talked to
since high school. It's interesting to get the summary of somebody's
life and to summarize my own. &quot;I went to college for a semester, dropped
out, worked in tech hardware manufacturing for a few years, was a video
editor for about 6 months, then started my career in computer technology
which took me from Colorado to California. I recently quit my job to
travel around SE Asia and am about to marry a Vietnamese girl and take
her back to America with me.&quot;</p>
<p>We went for breakfast and had a typical Asian breakfast in that it was
no different from any other meal. Thai iced coffee is delicious. The
menu was in English, as are many many things in Bangkok. My had said
that almost everybody here speaks English.</p>
<p>I asked Max about his career and he said he had been in IT, mainly
Oracle, and retired at 48. He's 54 now and plays stock market.</p>
<p>We were on our way to The Ancient City and drove for a while. Bangkok is
a very spread out city. I've noticed that there are many five story
apartment buildings, some with pillars and balconies. These building are
like an entire San Francisco block as a single building.</p>
<p>I wondered what it would take for Saigon or Long Xuyen to become a city
like Bangkok. Hanoi is already halfway there. Bangkok has very little
litter and I've seen people cleaning up on the side of the road. There
are several driving ranges nearby. There are many carson the road and a
stellar tollway system. Traffic in Bangkok is still a little crazy, just
in cars rather than on scooters. There is graffiti done by locals rather
than foreigners. I saw men in a water tanker watering plants in the
median of a boulevard. It's not that I want Saigon or Long Xuyen to be
Bangkok, it's just interesting to consider the steps between.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3663094398/"><img alt="Oriented" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2580/3663094398_355e30615c_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> We arrived at <a class="reference external" href="http://ancientcity.com/">The Ancient City</a>,
or Ancient Siam, which is a collection of large scale replicas of famous
sites in Thailand. They are smaller than the originals, but still large
enough to walk into. We got two bicycles to ride around. They both had
baskets on the front which turned out to be a great setup for easy
camera use. The sights were cool and it was an easy way to get a feel
for what Thailand had to offer. Many of the temples were familiar as I'd
already been tromping around Angkor. I took a lot of photos.</p>
<p>I saw a turtle running across the street and would've missed seeing it
had it not been for the sounds his feet were making as they scraped the
street.</p>
<p>We returned to the car and headed off. I saw a sign that said simply
&quot;Modify Dog&quot; and thought of Repet.</p>
<p>We went to a local mall to figure out some issues with my phone's data
plan. When I got my SIM card it came with a data plan, which I was
unaware of, and my automatic e-mail drained most of the balance in my
account. I turned off the auto e-mail check but still needed to fix the
balance and the data plan. I gave them 100 baht more, which is about $3,
and got 6 hours of data with 50 baht more for calling. This way of doing
things makes so much sense it's a shame that it's not more prominent in
America.</p>
<p>We also stopped off at a few shops to look at camera gear. The D700 is
just as expensive here as it is in America, and the LX3 is just as hard
to find.</p>
<p>We headed home. I decided to try out Skype on my data plan and was
incredibly disappointed to find that the Skype app on my iPhone was
preventing me from making phone calls &quot;due to contractual agreements&quot;
that did not apply to my circumstances. Damn poorly programmed software,
damn AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Shortly after we arrived home My came walking tiredly in and showed us
her fresh new driver's license. 20 years old and finally able to drive.
Max had told me earlier that she would probably get the nice 2006 Toyota
SUV we've been cruising around town in.</p>
<p>Mint also came home soon and we all went to dinner at the same
restaurant we had dinner at last night and breakfast this morning. The
food is great, the drinks are good. At the back of the restaurant one of
the employees was changing her baby's diaper. On TV there were
<a class="reference external" href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/27/content_11609580.htm">elephants dressed up like panda
bears</a>,
then they were lifting a yak out of an oil change pit at a gas station
that it had fallen into, then a yak gave birth to a baby yak, then they
were testing cell phones for lightning attraction.</p>
<p>Yak birth is not appropriate dinner media, and cell phones do not
attract lightning.</p>
<p>The TVs here support multiple audio channels and some shows broadcast in
both Thai and English. You can switch between them just like a DVD.</p>
<p>They have pizza delivery motorbikes. I'm going to take this idea back to
San Francisco and make a million dollars.</p>
<p>I saw a girl at a bus stop with a t-shirt that said &quot;I &lt;3 6/9&quot;. That
date has no significance in Thailand so I assumed it was a sexual
engrish t-shirt.</p>
<p>We went to a nearby park where there are waterways, big grass lawns and
the Kings museum where you can read blurbs about the king and see what
kind of things he's into. As we approached the museum a man blew a
whistle and everybody in the park stood up. &quot;National song.&quot; We all
stood there, most with their hands at their sides as the custom goes,
until the song was over, then we all returned to what we were doing.</p>
<p>We saw the museum. The King seems like a great man, great leader and a
great role model for a well rounded lifestyle. My and I went for a walk
around the park as the sun was setting. We found a Chinese garden and
inside of the garden I found a very large weird animal which I thoguht
was a baby crocodile but ended up being an ant eater. We saw several
more ant eaters swimming around and got lost in the park while we were
looking at them and talking about animals. We found our way home, found
her sister and father and went home for the night.</p>
<p>I thought about the next few weeks and about what I'll do with my time.
The dynamic change between backpacking solo and being a hosted guest is
pretty significant. As a backpacker you can go where you want when you
want and do what you want, but as a hosted guest there is a shift
towards group outings and to the lifestyle of those hosting you. It's an
interesting shift and it's easy to lose sight of the fact that you are
in fact traveling. I don't want to outstay my welcome or expire the
hospitality of my hosts, and I want to continue my travels to northern
Thailand and Laos. I have 9 days until I need to be back in Saigon to
meet Tien. I really need to figure out a tentative schedule...</p>
