		<p>Wednesday I woke up to hurricane winds and our hotel shaking. I moved
the love seat in off the patio expecting to have torrential rains
hitting soon, then I went back to sleep. When I woke up 3 hours later
everything was calm. I guess that's just how night weather is on the
west coast of Malaysia.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I dream it is like a movie with actors and character
development, a climax and an ending. Some times the credits roll. This
night I had a dream in that style about a big heist, but not a bank
heist. It was something about ripping off a big corporation. I remember
less of the plot from this dream than probably any other dream I've had
like this, but I do remember the ending where about 4 of us survived an
ambush. The whole dream was narrated by Morgan Freeman.</p>
<p>Tien and I were awake in time for breakfast this morning so we went
downstairs and had a surprisingly good meal. We went back upstairs and
relaxed for a bit and tried to figure out if we should leave, and then
after a big pillow fight we decided to pack up. We checked out and
caught a Mercedes Benz taxi back to the bus station. We got on the bus
to Seremban, the city where we had to transfer to a train that would
take us back to Kuala Lumpur. We turned on some music and zoned out and
nearly missed the station. Luckily I happened to see the walkway we'd
taken a few days earlier and recognized it in time to get off at the
exactly right stop.</p>
<p>While we were waiting at the train station I saw a scale and decided to
weigh myself and my backpack. I weighed 97 kg with a bunch of stuff in
my pockets, and my backpack was 16 kg. I have to say I'm pretty happy
with my backpack, especially since it holds 35 lbs of gear comfortably.</p>
<p>We boarded our train and headed off. I was staring out the window
watching forests of palm trees pass by when I was struck with a craving
for Mexican food. Then I thought about Puerto Alegre in San Francisco
and how lovely their guacamole is with a margarita. There was no chance
to have anything like that here though, so I let the thought go...</p>
<p>We checked back into the Mandarin Pacific in KL and had a rest, then
headed out to find the Petronas Twin Towers. On our way down to the
Pasar Seni station I smelled cloves in the air and realized that it
wasn't the first time I had smelled them in Malaysia. I guess people
here love cloves, and I can't blame them.</p>
<p>Four stops down the line we got off at a subway stop called KLCC and
walked up a few flights of stairs. Walking up the steps from a subway
into a new city is always an exciting thing and I recalled my first time
walking up to Stockton and Market in San Francisco. I wasn't sure what
to expect here in KL, but what I did see when we walked out was a huge ƒ
building. I wasn't sure what it was but I began photographing it, and as
we strafed it I realized that it was in fact one of the two Petronas
Towers.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4320479369/"><img alt="Petronas Twin Towers" class="align-left" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4005/4320479369_d1a8cd1574_n.jpg" style="width: 210px; height: 320px;" /></a> The Petronas Towers were enormous and awesome.
I'd never seen such at glorious building before. They were shiny and
clean and all of the spaces surrounding them were huge. Huge entryways,
huge fountain, huge driveways. Tien and I spent a long while
photographing them from near and far, and then went inside to take more
photos. Inside on the bottom levels is a four or five story mall.
Outside in the back is a large patio with an impressive fountain and an
island. We took many many photos and some videos. Tien had never been
inside of a shopping mall before and had never seen skyscrapers aside
from those in Saigon, which aren't really skyscrapers so much as tall
buildings.</p>
<p>After we got tired from awe at the towers we were hungry, and since mall
food tends to suck I resisted the urge to let Tien try Pizza Hut for the
first time and we walked a block away and found a better, cheaper
restaurant than what would've been available at the KLCC mall. I was
beginning to feel a little ill in my digestive system, but that didn't
stop me from enjoying two beers and a delicious plate of spaghetti with
chicken. Tien got some sort of delicious chicken and rice dish and honey
lemonade. We sat and enjoyed our food as it got dark, then returned to
the Petronas Towers to take some photos of it at night. They are much
more impressive at night because of how they are lit up. Aside from the
unique Menara Kuala Lumpur Tower, the rest of the skyline wasn't even
remarkable when compared to these towers.</p>
<p>We were really tired by this point so we got on the train and managed to
stay awake. Between the train station and the hotel I began thinking
about an old friend I used to work with named Ron Abitbol. Sometimes we
had to travel for work to the same places, but we didn't work together
all that long. Ron lived out of his car about half of the time, and
sometimes he'd live in his boat or in an actual dwelling of some sort.
He was a unique character, his own man. Some people thought he was
weird, and I guess he was. He did his own thing pretty much all the
time. Before I had met him he had gone to Mexico for a long time and
worked on a boat. He ended up marrying a Mexican girl and bringing her
back to America. He would wander all over. I felt like I might be a Ron.</p>
<p>That night I slept unusually poor. The sickness had set in and kept me
up frequently. Even so, we ended up sleeping in late and missing
breakfast on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>We decided to go to the Batu Caves, a place I'd wanted to see since I
saw Taka's photos of it. As we were getting ready a screw fell loose on
my glasses like it had back at Angkor Wat. We wandered around looking
for a micro screwdriver and found an optics shop where a girl tightened
the loose screw for me.</p>
<p>A block later we found a small temple and were invited inside. We went
in and as I was taking photos I noticed that the battery on my camera
was nearly dead. We went back to the hotel and ended up staying there
and not going to the caves at all because I felt so ill. Tien went to
find some medicine and food. I had told her to get some dried fruit. She
returned with medicine, tea and junkfood which she said was the closest
thing she could find to fried food. She did have some multigrain
crackers though and that was nice.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3757988082/"><img alt="Tiny Watchers" class="align-right" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2434/3757988082_c2344d4651_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 183px;" /></a>We napped the afternoon away and when I woke up I was
antsy and feeling a little better, but rather than Batu Caves, we went
to Menara KL looking for a geocache.</p>
<p>Two train stops up we began what was a decent walk to the top of a hill.
As we got near the cache location a group of monkeys came running up. We
took photos of them and watched them play and preen. When a Menara
security guard finally left we found the cache and dropped off a travel
bug I'd found in SF. This was Tien's first geocache.</p>
<p>Since we were at Menara we decided to go up into the tower. It was
nearly sunset and the views were gorgeous. It really helped me see the
space of the city, which was larger than the maps had led me to think.</p>
<p>There were many Islamic families in the tower and many of the women were
dressed head to toe in black with just eyes and hands showing. One of
them was having her photo taken, which I thought was funny since you
couldn't see almost any of her. It was like taking a portrait of
somebody wearing a gorilla suit; it could be anybody. I thought about
that custom and the more I thought about it I became slightly offended
at it. I couldn't put my reason into words but I was definitely offended
and that was strange since I don't usually get offended by people's
lifestyles.</p>
<p>We went back down the 1 minute elevator ride, me feeling slightly ill on
the way, and at the bottom found a vendor playing with a really neat
crazy remote controlled car. I ended up buying it for Tien's nieces.</p>
<p>We took a shuttle down the hill to the street. The radio was playing a
local Malaysian radio station with pop hits in English. One thing I like
about Malaysia is that almost everybody speaks English. On top of that,
many of the Malay words are misspellings of english words. For example,
restoran, motorsikal, ekspress, monorel, and bas.</p>
<p>I had a hard time staying awake on the train home because I hadn't eaten
a proper meal in a day and was extremely dehydrated due to my ongoing
gastrointestinal problems. There was a sign on the train that said
&quot;Three seats are reserved for senior citizens, disabled and pregnant
ladies. Aren't we courteous?&quot;</p>
<p>Back at the hotel I noticed the the battery in my LX3 was dead so I
plugged it in with a funky 3 prong plug. Back in Vietnam I'd looked at
that plug and had nearly thrown it away since my American plugs had been
working great everywhere. In Malaysia though, all power plugs were these,
and I'd used that cable to charge my Nikon and my laptop.</p>
<p>I was starving by this point so we went for food. I very irritably
dragged Tien Through the market and settled on chicken fried rice with
sprite, which was very satisfying. We then went to look for some gifts
for her family at the market but couldn't find anything that really
stood out and decided to get some perfume once we were back in Saigon,
since we probably couldn't bring it on the plane. We headed back to the
hotel and packed for our early departure the next day. I always take a
long time to pack so I gave Tien On the Road by Jack Kerouac and had her
read aloud to me while I packed.</p>
<p>We got to sleep later than I had hoped, and 6am came too soon. We hit the
train to sentral and arrived at nearly 7, which was a bit later than
planned. Even at that time, Starbucks was not open, and we weren't going
to eat McDonalds, so we just got on the KLIA Ekspres and went to the
airport with the intention of getting breakfast there. We ended up
arriving much later than I had planned, and I was a little worried that
the lines through passport control would be as long as last time we were
there, but the whole process of getting into the international terminal
was actually very easy. This ease was the last bit of joy I experienced
in Malaysia.</p>
<p>There were pretty much no breakfast places in the airport. I say this
from the perspective beyond passport control. After making one of my
innumerable uncomfortable bathroom breaks that were the result of my
ongoing illness, we went to a cafe and got coffees and a vanilla muffin,
which would've made a great breakfast if we had time to eat it. Instead,
we went down the travellators (that's what they call the moving
walkways) and got to our gate. At the gate there were unsurprisingly no
places to sit, and surprisingly another xray security checkpoint. I put
our coffee, the muffin, my phone, LX3, iPod and the remote controlled
car into a tray and passed it through the metal detectors. On the other
side I received my electronic devices soaking wet with coffee that had
spilled as it went through the machine, along with the spoken notice,
although it was not written anywhere, that I was not allowed to bring
drinks into the gate waiting area. I had run my coffee through the
machine and spilled it all over my new camera, phone and iPod for
nothing.</p>
<p>I drank some of my drinks and left the rest there, picked up my soggy
electronic devices and my muffin, and proceeded to the waiting area for
our gate, complete with plenty of chairs and absolutely nothing else.
This was a place meant for people to wait, yet they could not bring
liquids in, and there were no restaurants or even a drinking fountain. I
sat there dehydrated from my illness and ate my muffin with no liquid to
wash it down.</p>
<p>I then boarded a plane and sat there for over 30 minutes with really
irritating music that sounded like french music mixed with banghra being
played backwards, and a screaming brat in the next seat over. Neither
Tien nor I could understand a single word spoken by the man who offered
us a meal on the plane, and we ended up getting a meal that was to me
entirely inedible. At least I got a few tablespoons of Sprite.</p>
<p>Malaysian Airlines had bragged about being one of the few five star
airlines in the world, but judging from their airport and their air
service, I honestly wouldn't choose them if I am ever given a choice
again, and I'll avoid KLIA or at least plan ahead if I have to go there.</p>
<p>I managed to find some calm by listening to Chicane very loudly and
closing my eyes, but as we landed that terrible music came back on and
that brat started screaming louder, and I felt a little like I was on an
airplane straight to hell. We were in Saigon though, so at least that
was good.</p>
<p>We landed. I exchanged my ringgits and some Lao money that I still had
into dong, slew a few taxi touts, and found a good driver to take us to
the familiar District 1, Pham Ngu Lao, and the Ruby Star.</p>
