		<p>Friday we woke up and did some internet stuff. I was catching up on a
lot of Internet in the morning. Tien got me a breakfast sandwich and
made me a banana and strawberry smoothie. What a lucky guy I am, my
fiance bringing me food at my computer!</p>
<p>Tien found the information we needed about how to get me a drivers
license in Vietnam and it was incredibly simple. We headed to Long Xuyen
to get the things we needed in order to apply for it: a photograph of
20x23mm and a notarized translation of my CA driver's license. We also
cruised around to look for a DC power adapter since I forgot the one
that goes with the WRT54G that I brought from America. We found one near
a park, and after buying it I decided to go take some photos in the
park. I was looking for high places to photograph down from in order to
make the miniature perspective of the tilt/shift work, so we also headed
up to the Panda Cafe on the 6th floor of a building overlooking a main
intersection and had some drinks and took some more photos from there.
We then cruised down to a local market area, past a block full of flower
vendors that smelled a lot like San Jose smells in the spring. I told
Tien about this as we were passing through. We picked up some stuff for
Thu and headed home to spend the evening hanging out with her family. I
tried to hook up the WRT54G and found that the power adapter did not
work.</p>
<p>Saturday morning we woke up and headed straight to the translation
service and then to the police station. It was a day for people to drop
things. While we were riding along I saw three people drop things off of
their motorbikes. I've also noticed that school is in session now
because the streets are full of uniformed students. The girls look
beautiful in their all-white traditional clothes, and the boys have a
classic schoolboy look in their blue pants, white shirts and red ties.
Most of them ride bicycles to school, some hitching rides with others or
on motorbikes.</p>
<p>When we got to the police station they informed us that they couldn't
give me a driver's license unless my visa was good for at least 3 more
months. This was mildly disappointing and I couldn't help but wonder if
it was a subtle attempt at extortion. I didn't care enough to find out
so we left and went to have brunch at a cafe where we often used to go
to surf the net. The food was OK and the drinks were great. We talked
about our plans to travel to Nha Trang and possibly to Thailand, what
else we would do while I was here, and about whether or not I would
return to the USA on Nov 25th, which I think is likely.</p>
<p>We went and swapped the power adapter for one that we thought should
work even though it was slightly underpowered, cruised the 20 minutes
home from Long Xuyen and found that it did not work. I really didn't
think it would be so hard to find a 12v 500mA DC adapter, but surprise
surprise, Vietnam is full of surprises.</p>
<p>That evening we went out in the neighborhood for a walk. We stopped at a
little cafe where some locals were watching a ridiculous television
show. We ate ice cream and mosquitoes ate me. My ice cream was one of
those triple flavors, chocolate, mint and durian. That was
interesting... it's the first time I've had durian since I knew it was
the &quot;stinky fruit.&quot; It definitely has a very, very odd and distinct
flavor and scent.</p>
<p>Tien and I ate dinner on the floor with her mom and sister that evening.
I was a little melancholy and I think this made them slightly
uncomfortable, but it's not like we could talk about it. The
side-effects of not being able to speak to anybody except Tien were
beginning to get to me.</p>
<p>Aside from nonverbal communication, another thing that was getting to me
was a pain I'd had in my ankle. Ever since I got off the plane in Tokyo
I had a pretty significant pain in my left ankle. I thought it might be
a pulled muscle or a bruise on my ankle, but the more I had thought
about it the more I thought it might be something with my ligaments. It
is a pain stretching from the middle of my shin on the inside, down to
the top part of my ankle joint, and also is affected by the arch of my
foot. Tien gave me a massage and rubbed some Ben Gay™ that her brother
in law had brought from america and that made it feel much better,
though not healed.</p>
<p>Sunday morning I woke up at 7:15, which is early for me. While Tien and
I were at the market having breakfast I saw a shirt that said &quot;Do u know
now much plannet u mean to me&quot; and thought that was pretty funny. We
talked a bit about where we wanted to go on a trip, and afterwards we
headed to Long Xuyen to find yet another power adapter.</p>
<p>After visiting about 10 stores we finally tracked down a 498mA power
adapter and decided to buy it even though the man at the shop said it
was not very good quality. We took a back road to get back to the main
road which I always enjoy because I like seeing new areas. The road took
us by the river and on the way we found a crowd of people standing at
the waters edge. They weren't celebrating, but they weren't frantic
either. Tien listened to what they were saying and told me that a child
had fallen into the river.</p>
<p>A man away from the crowd began to shout, but nobody paid attention. I
thought this was interesting because it seems that Vietnamese people
shout a lot. This ended up being one of those &quot;never cry wolf&quot;
situations because he was trying to tell them he saw something in the
water. A few more people also began shouting and soon a teenage boy ran
over and jumped in the water to look for the child there. Several people
swam along the shore, which dropped off very steeply, and were diving
under looking for the child. We stayed a while but the child was never
found...</p>
<p>I had talked to Tien before about how children here are not taught to
swim which leads to many of them drowning, and here was a real life
example of such a tragedy. I feel stupid and ashamed that I never
thought about the fact that the children in Tien's family can't swim and
it wasn't until a few days later that one of her other family members
suggested that they be put in swimming lessons. Tien couldn't swim when
I met her, and I wondered if anybody else in her family could.</p>
<p>When we got home I tried the power adapter on the wireless router and it
was too unstable and thus did not work. I decided to give up on the
whole thing, I'll just mail the power adapter once I get back to the
USA.</p>
<p>That night I opened a bottle of Da Lat red and had wine with dinner. It
was the first wine I'd had since leaving California and it was delicious
and familiar. It felt good to have a familiar taste that is heavily
bound to California. That night I slept deeply.</p>
<p>Tien and I had planned to go to Nha Trang on Monday, a beach resort town
up towards Danang, but that morning Tien said we weren't going to go.
She had a sore on her mouth and did not want to travel far until it was
healed. I wasn't sure if this was for medical or aesthetic reasons,
though I suspected both and agreed.</p>
<p>At breakfast I was trying to teach Ngoc some english words and realized
that she had a very difficult time saying words that begin with the
letter S. I asked Tien about it and she said there are very few words in
Vietnamese that begin with that letter. I thought about phonetics
exercises and games that we could do to train her mouth to say english
words.</p>
<p>Instead of going to Nha Trang we talked about going back to Mt. Cam
where we could hike up the mountain and swim in the pools of the stream
that go down from the lake on top of the mountain. We made tentative
plans to do this the next day. We also made tentative plans to teach
Ngoc and Nhi how to swim in the pool in Long Xuyen.</p>
<p>We had lunch and I wondered about why there were no tuk tuk's in
Vietnam. Tien said that her dad and brother both used to be tuk tuk
drivers, but a while back the police said that people weren't allowed to
have them anymore. She couldn't explain the detailed reasons why, but
said that one of the reasons was because there were too many motorbikes.
I suspected that the tuk tuks were causing accidents or clogged traffic.
I found it hard to believe that anything was limited on the streets of
Vietnam, it seems like you can ride whatever you can build on the
street.</p>
<p>That afternoon was very uneventful and empty, and the boredom of Binh
Hoa began to set in. We were going nowhere and I couldn't talk to
anybody except Tien. I was sitting idle and feeling like I was wasting
away. Tien and her sisters decided that evening that we would go to a
Catholic All Saints Day festival that was going on up the highway. I
wasn't in much of a mood to go by this point, but it was better than
sitting at home and I was up for anything at that point.</p>
<p>The crowd was huge. People were filling up the little two lane highway
and vendors came to sell flashy lights, stuffed animals, foods, all
sorts of trinkets and just about anything. There were hundreds of people
walking along the highway buying things, chatting, riding bikes, talking
on cell phones, etc.. Some were going to the graveyard to burn incense
and light candles for their loved ones. Very few were going to church to
pray.</p>
<p>I felt very uncomfortable in that crowd. It was like being so famous
that every single person in the crowd knew me, but I wasn't famous for
necessarily good reasons. And it was like I had a sign around my neck
that said &quot;please say hello.&quot; Hundreds of eyes watched me as I did
absolutely nothing interesting. People laughed and joked while watching
me. Dozens of people shouted &quot;hello&quot; and dozens more said things that I
couldn't understand. If I had been in a better mood I think it might
have been OK, but with my frustrations from being so idle I wasn't
really in a good mood for it.</p>
<p>Instead I just tried to take photos of stuff, but was uninspired. The
night was also very dark and it was hard to get a clear picture. We went
to the church and I took some photographs of that, lamenting that I had
no tripod. I resolved to buy one or make one.</p>
<p>The incense at the church smelled wonderful on the air and there was a
full moon.</p>
<p>That night I talked briefly with Tien about how I was frustrated with
the inability to communicate and the fact that we weren't finding
anything to do except be lazy at home. We decided to go ahead and go to
Nha Trang.</p>
