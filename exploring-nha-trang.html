		<p>The winds howled through the cracks of the door and windows of our hotel
room all night and the next morning was very breezy. I spent a large
portion of the morning catching up on all the internet stuff I'd missed
during my offline stay in Mui Ne. Most notably, a 3D mandelbrot set had
been discovered and rendered into some impressive images. I also noticed
that I had exactly one week left in Vietnam.</p>
<p>I was feeling significantly more I'll that morning, but I thought I
might only have a sinus cold or something lame and trivial so I didn't
pay much attention to it, expecting that it would go away in a few days</p>
<p>The cold water In our bathroom was broken so that only boiling hot water
came out of the shower until there was no more, then it went to only
cold water. This behavior would continue throughout our stay there,
requiring us to take cold shower baths.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4114626370/"><img alt="Nha Trang waterfront from the Manchester Hotel" class="aligncenter" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2752/4114626370_ef6a563581.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 177px;" /></a></p>
<p>We got breakfast late that morning at the place directly next door to
The Manchester that I wouldn't recommend. Over breakfast Tien and I
talked a lot about humor and jokes. Even though there seem to be a lot
of differences between Vietnamese and American humor, there also seem to
be some global constants to humor. I tried to explain things like Knock
Knock jokes, one-liners, and other types of humor. Most jokes in
Vietnamese are longer jokes with a lot of context. This goes
hand-in-hand with their love for comedy theater.</p>
<p>After breakfast we took a walk down the beach where it was incredibly
windy. It was nice though to be out in the sun. The wind wasn't cold
either and that was nice. The weather looked stormy though, the waves
were huge and the water was really rough, so I wasn't too hopeful about
getting to swim.</p>
<p>We found our way back onto the sidewalk by the main road and passed an
area where there were about 50 large dragonflies hanging out. I thought
about photographing them, but didn't because I didn't have anything that
would make it easy to get a good shot. We also found many shops that
were selling seahorses, both alive and dead and in various containers.
Some were floating in liquid, some were dried and ready to be eaten
whole, and some were in fish tanks with nothing more than water. Tien
said that seahorses are supposed to have amazing medicinal functions,
just like eating live lizards. Lore is always a little humorous to me.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4186377527/"><img alt="Boats in Nha Trang" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2577/4186377527_9b734b10ac_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> The destination on our walk was a place called the
Vinpearl, and it was amazingly difficult to walk there. We actually had
to walk beyond it over a hill and then come around back to it, winding
in the roads of its campus that had no sidewalks. Clearly this place was
made to be traveled to and from by motor vehicle.</p>
<p>The Vinpearl is actually a huge island theme park with a lot of
attractions. We didn't know this when we set out to go there, but
discovered it when we arrived at the mainland side of a gondola that
takes people to and from the island. There were also boats of various
size that would ferry people back and forth. I was feeling pretty tired
from my illness and the walk and didn't feel like I had the energy for a
theme park, so we opted to go back another day and instead spend our day
on the mainland. We intended to visit an aquarium, but when we got into
the taxi and told him to take us there he said it was on the Vinpearl
island. This was another mistake of not doing research and not using the
guidebook. I'm never going anywhere without the guidebook again.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4236624600/"><img alt="Tien at Ponagar" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4236624600_fb4603cdbd_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a>Instead of going to the aquarium we went to a place
called Ponagar Tower that was an ancient stone temple. It was a bit like
something you'd find at Angkor Wat. It was a small temple but Tien
enjoyed it much. There was an older Japanese man doing tricks with tops,
swords and yo-yo's on the upper landing of the complex. He was pretty
funny, partly because he kept messing up. He would say everything in
Japanese and there was a translator and a few drum players beating on
tribal drums for dramatic effect as he did things like accidentally
throwing a top larger than my head, nearly hitting a bystander.</p>
<p>I was feeling increasingly ill and tired so we headed back to The
Manchester for a nap. I was developing some flu like symptoms like fever
and sore throat, so I assumed that's what it was. We went for dinner and
found an absolutely delicious pho place at the end of a dark alley and
conveniently near a pharmacist. We had our dinner and picked up a
cocktail of medication for my symptoms.</p>
