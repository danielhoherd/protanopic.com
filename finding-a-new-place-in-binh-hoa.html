Tien and I were still recovering from our motorbike trips and I swore
off ever going long distances on Tien's scooter ever again. We did,
however, plan to head north from Saigon to Mui Ne and Nha Trang the
following day by bus, and hopefully also by train.</p>
<p>We stayed around the house all day, but that evening we went for a ride
around town at sunset. I brought my camera gear and photographed some
boats in the river. We turned this way and that while riding through her
village, going along waterways and over bridges, waving to the folks on
the boats I was photographing and to the locals we passed who beamed at
the sight of a white guy.</p>
<p>Right before dusk I spotted a big rice paddie that hadn't been
harvested, the same one I had photographed tien at a few days earlier
but on the opposite, remote side. There are so few places in Tien's
village where you can get right next to the rice paddies and I was
excited to find such a great spot. On top of that, Tien said she had
never been there. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4116222967/"><img alt="We found ourselves here" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/4116222967_05fa06be29_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> I was happy to have shown
tien a beautiful new place in her own village. Unfortunately the light
was dark and I had no tripod so I couldn't take the photos I wanted, but
I did the best I could. We sat a minute and enjoyed the vast green
before us, then turned on our dirt path and headed back home.</p>
<p>This neighborhood was distinctly different from most of the places she
had taken me. It was pretty hard to get to and far from the main roads.
Most of the houses had open front walls, giving you full view into the
living rooms where people were watching TV, playing with their kids,
praying. Many of the houses had only a fence, not hard steel locking
gate. Some had only glass windows on a locking door. I liked this
neighborhood, it was like a tiny remote village tucked just 1km off the
main road.</p>
