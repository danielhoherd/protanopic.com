		<p>Saturday morning in Binh Hoa, I've been in Vietnam for nearly a week now
and I it's been a good gentle immersion in to Asian culture in the
tropics. Tonight Tien and I will go by overnight bus to Vung Tàu Beach,
which is about 20km outside Ho Chi Minh city, and spend the next day
there. Monday I plan to fly to Hanoi and do a 4 day tour at Ha Long
Beach. I'm not sure when I'll have internet access beyond today, but I
expect to have it wherever I'm staying in Hanoi since it's going to be
more of a resort style thing, a popular tourist destination.</p>
<p>My iPhone has been failing to function as a GPS receiver, which sucks
because it's the only one I brought that has a screen. I was surprised
to see that there are only 2 <a class="reference external" href="htp://www.geocaching.com">geocaches</a> in
Saigon, one of which was a virtual, and three in Hanoi. Looking at the
standard of living here, it makes sense, but I still expected there to
be a district where there were more, or in parks outside of town, or
something.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3599203843/"><img alt="Binh Hoa sky" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2440/3599203843_3a063834ca_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> Last night Tien, her sister and I went to the bank to
figure out some money thing for my trip. For some reason they wouldn't
let me pay with credit, so I ended up going to the ATM outside and
pulling out 1m, took some cash from my wallet and put down 2.8m on the
trip.</p>
<p>This is roughly equivalent to $160 USD.</p>
<p>When I first went to the bank and exchanged a several 20's for a stack
of 50,000's all I could think of was Snow Crash's hyper-inflation. An
average meal can cost 20,000. A taxi ride can cost 300,000. I wonder why
they don't just drop those extra 3 zeros. I talked to Majed online and
he joked about how I left my job a millionaire.</p>
<p>After we got the details of the money and registration for my trip
worked out we left, and then were almost immediately called because of
an error in my name, and then called again because we didn't put down
enough money up front. When we got back to the bank it was closed. The
problem is that I have to leave on Monday, and the bank won't be open
until Monday, so I'm not sure how this is going to work out. But hey,
that's part of the fun, right?</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3599203829/"><img alt="Science Experiment?" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/3599203829_c1ba0754eb_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> Later last night we went back to a nearby city and
had some food and drinks and tried to find a US to Asian power adapter,
which nobody has. As usual a lot of people were out enjoying the cool
night. I've found that people like night here and I assume a big reason
is because it's cooler and more conducive to style and enjoyment.
Vietnam is the only place I've been where it's common to see a
beautiful, slender girl in figure fitting clothes that you can vaguely
see through wearing high heels and riding a motorcycle.</p>
<p>On the way to town I noticed how common it is to see platonic same-sex
affection. From what I know about the conservative guy/girl
relationships this makes sense. I saw girls walking hand in hand, and
three guys with their arms on each others shoulders. This type of thing
is common, but seeing those two in succession made me realize how
prevolent it is. I thought about how it was starkly different from
places like Paris where you see lovers when you're out at night, but
here you see friends.</p>
<p>I saw a man on a motorbike using his right foot to push a man on a
manual-pedal tricycle down the highway.</p>
<p>I could do a whole photo book on the spiral staircases in Vietnam.
They're everywhere, and they're really pretty. Most nice houses have a
spiral staircase going up to the roof. Most two floor houses have a
spiral staircase going up from the back of the great room that takes up
most of the bottom floor.</p>
<p>There seem to be two kinds of houses here. Single floor houses made from
cement and wood, extended with tin walls and awnings. Then there are
several floor houses which are painted, have balconies, big windows,
etc.. It's the only big difference other than quality of motorbike that
I've seen so far to distinguish poor people from rich people. It's
really awesome that there is not a huge disparity between the rich and
the poor here, not so much as in America at any rate. I like that the
majority of the people are in the middle, not at the upper and lower
ends. It's actually a lot like Yentown from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowtail_Butterfly_(film)">Swallowtail
Butterfly</a>.
I noticed this a few days ago and it was a slight revelation as to why I
feel so at home here in VN. That is my favorite movie, after all.</p>
<p>Today Tien and I sat down at the market and ate breakfast and drank
coffee again. This has been a pretty daily occurrence, and I really enjoy
it. I'll miss it. We talked about musical classification, and the larger
issue which is general classification of information and its attributes.
We talked about traveling, my trip, family, America, intelligence, jobs,
what makes a good life. I think Tien is brilliant and she just doesn't
know it. I told her so too. She asks questions beyond the obvious ones
and understands things very quickly. I think she may be a genius.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Before I left America many people told me I'd have terrible digestive
problems when I got here, but actually I think I've had less than I did
in San Francisco. In fact I haven't had any problems until today, and
they were incredibly minor. This is interesting to me because it's not
like I've been sticking to the &quot;don't drink iced drinks and don't eat
vegetables&quot; advice that my doctor gave me.</p>
