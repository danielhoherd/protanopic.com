		<p>On May 20 Tien and I woke up on the island of Phu Quoc, went downstairs
for breakfast and then took the moto out to have a look around the
town. We bought a proper swimsuit for
her, some sunscreen, and tried to find me a helmet, which is a continual
failure.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4624742726/"><img alt="Sad, broken puppy" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4624742726_fa724f5e5d_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 154px;" /></a>Right as we were coming around the corner to one of
the shops a puppy got run over by a motorbike that broke it's leg. The
dog lay in the street yelping for a few minutes as we all looked in with
pity before a little girl came and helped the dog back to her shop. Tien
and I went to the shop to buy stuff and the poor puppy looked so sad,
yelping and crying and looking around scared. Poor thing. At least he
was alive though, and not being eaten.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel Tien and I prepared to go back down to the beach to go
swimming, but as we were leaving the hotel staff asked us why we weren't
going to bai sao, the prettiest beach on the island. It was 45 minutes
away by moto, down the road we had taken the previous night. We decided
to head there instead, which was a fantastic change of plans.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4625990726/"><img alt="Boat on the western shore" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3343/4625990726_623eba13b3_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>Once we got past the construction and
actually by the coast it was absolutely beautiful. I couldn't believe
how vivid the colors were. The ocean was emerald and blue all the way to
a crisp horizon. The water was calm and reflected the large billowing
clouds in the true blue sky.  Our motorbike was pretty good and had the
larger tires so it handled well on the dirt roads. There were some rough
places though, like a bridge with huge gaps between the metal plates
that covered the construction going on below.</p>
<p>We found our way to a little resort by the beach where we ran into the
man who rented us our motorbike. He gave me a keychain, which I thought
was strange before Tien told me it was the same guy. We also ran into a
girl from Tiens village who was working at the resort. She sometimes
shopped at Tiens family's store, and now we were buying beach towels
from her.</p>
<p>The resort was a tropic paradise with clear waters on white sand, slow
rolling waves over shallow waters that extended beyond a hundred meters.
The water was warm, and later got hot enough that we had to swim way out
to find the cool patches.</p>
<p>We rented two beach chairs and go. A menu. A little puppy came wandering
up and we played with it a little before leaving it at the waters edge
where it was scared of the waves.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4624028199/"><img alt="Floating in the big bathtub" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4624028199_536c6c5ea1_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 168px;" /></a>We swam in the shallows, most of the time
less than a meter deep. I swam way out to find some deep water but ended
up just getting stung on my foot four times while checking if I could
feel the bottom. Even where it was six feet deep I wore my sunglasses
because the water was clear and calm enough that I was t worried about
losing them.</p>
<p>We grabbed the cameras and waded out to take photos, not scared of
submerging them in the shallows, then went back to the shore for ice
cream and cold beer. After a few hours we decided to get a real meal
elsewhere, and as we were leaving I saw a sick man throwing up. I was
glad not to know whether it was the food.</p>
<p>Tien and I headed to a stream that was supposed to be beautiful, but
when we got there it was all dried up.  With that we decided to just
grab lunch a the hotel and ended up napping the rest of the day away.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4640332717/"><img alt="32::AM::131" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3506/4640332717_06d43aeaba_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a>May 21 we woke up to rainy weather and ended up staying
inside sorting through photos as we waited to leave. On the boat back to
the mainland we played ipad games, listened to music while it rained and
sometimes thundered out on the distant ocean. We also passed an island
with a big white statue that looked like a saint next to what looked
like temple gates.</p>
<p>The scattered rain kept up as we caught moto taxis to a bus station. I'm
always glad the rain in SE Asia is warm.</p>
<p>We ate and had coffee while waiting for the bus. A woman let her child
stand up on the motorbike to pick frui. From a tree. A girl came by
wearing a shirt that said &quot;Product Bros.&quot;</p>
<p>The bus we caught was a big badass that everybody moved over for. Inside
was a movie about children doing Kung Fu. Movies where kids do adult
things like fight biker gangs and seduce bikini clad babes drive me
crazy.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I noticed a stream of liquid running down the center of the bus and
looked back expecting to see a toppled bottle, but</div>
<div class="line">Kid peenstead I saw a man picking a toddler up from her squatted
position in the aisle and putting her back on his lap. A bus employee
got a newspaper and tried to clean up the urine.</div>
</div>
<p>We switched buses in LX and were dropped off right in front of Tiens
parents house, then retired to thus house where we had dinner and slept
in our familiar bed.</p>
