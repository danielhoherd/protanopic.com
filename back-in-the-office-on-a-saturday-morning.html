		<p>*sigh* I forgot some paperwork at the office that I need in order to
get my Visas for Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. It's funny how my mind
works, I get so much good thinking done when I should be in deep sleep.
And by &quot;funny&quot; I mean &quot;kinda lame.&quot; Anyhow, I nearly startled awake on
the couch at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/tags/4211">4211</a> #1 this
morning with the realization that I'd forgotten this folder that I'm
keeping all of my Asia documents in, and with that as my number one
priority for the day I got in my car and started driving straight to the
coffee shop. Then I drove straight to the office, 50 miles away, with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Sunrise-DJ-Tiësto/dp/B00005NHKL">DJ Tiesto - In Search of
Sunrise</a>
in the speakers. Life is always better with a soundtrack.</p>
<p>When I got to the office there was a woman standing with her baby in the
center of the road into the parking lot of my office building. This
reminded me of something that has struck me lately... I've noticed that
the people who live in the new condos they build next door have what I
would consider to be a very miserable existence concerning their
neighborhood. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3312394653/"><img alt="Forget lost beauty" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3629/3312394653_d8ab9c1191_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> I see people walking their dogs and
taking their babies out for strolls through our parking lot, which
amazes me because there's a beautiful field in the exact opposite
direction. (And I mean beautiful in respect to what you tend to find in
the middle of a populated metroplex. Untended with small animal wildlife
doing their small wild animal things.) The area has been under
construction for the last 4 years. The mall next door has been going out
of business for longer than I've lived in the Bay Area. Even just the
other day a woman I met on the street who just arrived from Taiwan and
was lost told me she went into the mall and thought it was closed
because almost nobody was inside. Even though there is some beauty to be
found around here it seems so odd or incomplete or mismatched, seeing
somebody raise their family around that same poorly engineered, crummy
parking lot in an eternal construction zone on the corner of a freeway
exit at one of the most accident prone intersections in the South Bay. I
just don't understand that.</p>
<p>We all have our likes and dislikes, and who knows? Maybe they like just
having a place to call their own. As for me, I'm out. Just 2 weeks until
I'm sitting in Saigon discovering other ways of life that I don't
understand.</p>
