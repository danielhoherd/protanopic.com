		<p>I slept on Gecko and Brian's memory foam bed last night! It was
interesting, I've never slept on memory foam before. They are letting me
stay in their Menlo Park cottage while they attend a wedding in Arizona.</p>
<p>A girl named Megan Lau from Logitech came to my office to let me and Ray
Sennewald review some pre-release gear. For compensation she hooked us
both up with some logitech gear, and ga ve me a cool travel mouse that
will be very handy while I'm out on the road. I also got a webcam that
I'm not sure what to do with. It would've been great back at 4211 when
John was always stalking us at night.<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3529279863/"><img alt="image0" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3608/3529279863_70ca7d6596_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a></p>
<p>After work I met up with Chelsea. We had dinner at Erik's and then tried
out Beard Pappa's, which was underwhelming. Then we went hiking and
photographing up on Long Ridge. It was gorgeous, as it often is, and
this time it was nice to have a beautiful girl to photograph, and of
course it was good to have good company. We cruised back to Cupertino
and had tea at a coffee shop up on Foothills where cyclists often meet
before heading out into the hills.</p>
<p>Back at Gecko's it was nice to have a cottage to come home to, quiet and
homely. The Caltrain woke me up in the morning briefly, then sprinklers
after that. Unfamiliar sounds. I should get used to that. It was nice to
have a hot shower, which I sometimes have been going without lately, and
it would've been really nice to have a hot bath but I couldn't find
anything to plug the tub. I endured the patience testing madness that is
101 traffic via car and stopped off at Cafe Dolce for breakfast for old
time's sake.</p>
<p>And now that I've finished my breakfast burrito and am sipping on a
white mocha, I remember that I need to take my typhoid pills at least
two hours after eating and at least one hour before. Hm. =/</p>
