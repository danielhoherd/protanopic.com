		<p>The morning of May 18 we woke up with no power and again made plans
again to go to Ha Tien beach. We went to LX to have lunch and surf the
net and check out the bus station schedule.</p>
<p>We passed a white man with a white trimmed beard and thick nerdy glasses
riding a bicycle through the back streets of LX.</p>
<p>We decided to go to Phu Quoc instead of Ha Tien, and decided to go the
next morning. We'd hoped that somebody from Tien's family would come but
everybody had reasons to stay so it was just us two.</p>
<p>Early on May 19 we woke up to catch our bus. There were men outside of
thus house digging a ditch for a pipe of some sort. They were chiseling
right through the tile on thus front patio, and not one of them was
wearing protective eye gear.</p>
<p>Even though it was early I didn't feel tired like I had for the previous
few days and I remembered that my body adjusts it's energy level for the
pending activities. Now that we had plans I was wide awake and ready to
rock.</p>
<p>As we headed out I got a feeling that I setimes get on motorbikes... The
naked feeling that I should buckle in somehow, as if I'm in a car. Of
course there are no seatbelts on motorbikes, and in VN there aren't
often seatbelts in cars or buses either. If they're there they don't get
used.</p>
<p>On the ride to the bus station I saw a woman go to adjust the mirror on
her motorbike and have it break clean off.</p>
<p>We left the station at 8:10 and before long we found ourselves driving
on the wrong side of the road with a man hanging out of the open bus
door yelling. We sped past two trucks on our right as a tinny voice
blared out of a loudspeaker to our left and the sound of an alarm could
be heard from somewhere ahead. Just another typical day of travel in
Vietnam.</p>
<p>We stopped at a cafe where there was a sign with some Japanese fantasy
character on it. The word &quot;internet&quot; was followed by some Chinese
characters and then the words &quot;Final Step 3.0&quot;... oh squaresoft, look
what you've done. Same to you, internet buzzword machine.</p>
<p>The bus continued it loud caper down the highway which parralleled a
river all the way to the coast. There was a shrine on the dashboard and
a spare incense holder affixed to the frame of the passenger side
window.</p>
<p>We got off at Rach Soi and took motorbike taxis about 12 km to the
superdong ferry in Rach Gia. The ferry only left twice daily and we were
early, so we ate some food and waited. I noticed them loading motorbikes
on and off of other boats and had tien get th price of what it would
cost to take a motorbike. At 170k it wouldve been a much cheaper
alternative. Next time.</p>
<p>The boat ride was pretty smooth and we passed many small islands. The
seats were pretty small though and I was glad when we finally arrived.
The boat hadn't let us off where I thought it would. I thought it was
dropping us off in the city and so we hadn't bought a bus ticket to te
town. We ended up getting a taxi for not too much more who took us to a
decent hotel where we got a room and rented a motorbike.</p>
<p>We were hoping to go swimming and so we headed off in the bike to cruise
the coast in search of a nice beach, but it was too dark and the road
was under heavy construction which made it hard for us to navigate. We
ended up going back to the hotel and taking a quick dip in warm, dark
water with rapidly breaking waves. The swimming conditions weren't good
so we headed back to the hotel, grabbed the bike and heade to the night
market for dinner. The night market was small and didn't have anything
interesting, so we had our food and retired.</p>
<p>Over dinner I thought back to one year ago when I was preparing for my
first trip to VN. it was strang e to think that in one year, trawling
internationally, staying at random hotels in random places and
discovering new areas has become normal. It wa strange to think back to
a time when my comfort zone was so small that each night I wanted to be
in my own bed. Now I don't even own a bed, much less care where I sleep.</p>
