I walked
around a bit and Took pictures during sunset, then developed some photos
from a photoshoot I did for Rob's friends last weekend. I didn't bother
with the $6 Internet and before I knew it I was boarding the flight to
Saigon.</p>
<p>Vietnamese people are chatty, social people. I really wonder it is they
talk about so much. One man dropped a bag out o an overhead bin onto
another mans head across the aisle from me then apologized profusely.
There were kids running up and down the aisle of the plane, standing on
the seat playing with the lights, and a man got out of his seat right as
we were about to take off to help a woman with a screaming baby. I
couldn't help but smile at it all, what a show.</p>
<p>I sat next to a couple from Indiana who was on their way to volunteer at
a cafe called the masters cup which I took to be a Christian entity.
They were nice folks and I talked to the gentleman about traveling in
Asia. He mentioned that VN was limiting visas since about a month ago,
not giving out more than 30 day visas and for only a single entry. Good
thing I've still got my 6 month with over 30 days left.  He later said
that he had been in Vietnam during the war, which makes him the first
American I'd talked to about the war who had actually been in the war
and then come back. Regrettably we didn't get much time to talk about it
because I didn't find this out until the end of the flight.</p>
<p>We taxied forever and I soon drifted off with drams about taxiing to the
coast of Japan and then floating off across the ocean to Vietnam instead
of actually flying there. I woke up briefly for takeoff and then fell
asleep to the feelings of the g-force and the many conversations all
around, both of which were surprisingly calming. But then, it was 3am so
maybe that had something to do with it as well.</p>
<p>I thought I was dreaming when I woke up. On television was a mix between
Harry potter, star wars episode 1 and star trek. I wasn't dreaming
though, apparently this is some dreadful new show. I kept anticipating a
light saber duel between Spock and Malfoy.</p>
<p>I ordered a glass of wine and it was poured from an opaque plastic
bottle you'd expect to find juice in. Meh, it was free so I can't
complain.</p>
<p>We landed late and sat on the plane for a while before heading to the
gate.  I breezed through immigration and customs to find my lovely
fiancé Tien and her awesome sister Mai waiting for me at the front door.
We eventually found a taxi that would take Mai to the bus stop after
dropping Tien and I of at the familiar Ruby Star.</p>
<p>The streets of Saigon were mostly empty due to what must have been a
decent rain.  They were wet and shiny and looked clean.  It was great to
have my fiancé back after so long apart and so many frustrations with
I-129F. Here we were though, back in Saigon.  It was very familiar and
it seemed like only yesterday that I had been here.</p>
