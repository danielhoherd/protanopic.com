<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Why did you go?</td>
<td>Why not? I love traveling and was getting burned out on work, so it seemed like a good time for new travels to new places.</td>

<td>Two months.</td>

<td>No. This is forward progress, I don't plan to go backwards.</td>

<tr><td>How did you pay rent?</td>
<td>I didn't have rent. I lived out of my car for a month before leaving, staying with friends most of the time. It was great!</td>

<tr><td>When did you decide to do this?</td>
<td>I wanted to do something like this a long time ago, several years, but I decided to finally do it earlier this year, maybe like February.</td>

<td>I asked a wonderful Vietnamese girl to marry me while I was in Saigon.</td>

<tr><td>What!? You asked some random Vietnamese girl to marry you?!</td>
<td>No, I had known her for years beforehand. This was the right time, the right place and the right girl. :)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Did you bring her back to America with you?</td>
<td>No. American immigration is not at all what the poems claim. I have an entirely new outlook on the whole procedure. It's incredibly biased against poor countries and individuals who don't have large business interests in America.</td>

<h2>The long story</h2>
<div class="section" id="decisions">
<h3>Decisions</h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2009 it became evident that parts of my life were
not going the way I wanted them to.  Recent changes at my employer had
left my career going in the wrong direction and taking a heavy toll on
my spirits.  I needed a change.  I decided to quit my job and go to Asia
for a while.  For how long I didn't know, nor did I know what I would do
over there, or even where I'd go, those details would be worked out over
time.  I just knew I needed a change, so I made it happen.  Over the
course of several months I helped my employer hire a replacement for me
and help train him as I planned my trip to Asia.  At the end of May I
had my last day at my job and on that same day I flew to Saigon via
Tokyo.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-current-plan">
<h3>The Current Plan</h3>
<p>I had originally planned something vaguely like this...  Fly to Saigon
and spend some time in Vietnam with my friend Tien.  From there I wanted
to travel through Cambodia, Laos, back to Thailand, south through
Malaysia and down to Singapore, then back to Saigon to catch my plane
back to America.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-actual-experience">
<h3>The Actual Experience</h3>
<p>I got to Vietnam and was greeted by Tien and company.  We spent a few
days in Saigon and then headed back to Tien's home town.  Tien sent me
off to Ha Long bay for a week but was unable to go with me.  I missed
her greatly while I was there and on the plane back to Saigon I made a
big decision.  I asked Tien to marry me when I got back to Saigon.  From
there I did travel to Cambodia, Thailand and Laos by myself because Tien
had no passport.  When she finally got her passport I went back to
Vietnam where we celebrated our engagement, then went to Malaysia for a
week.  We spent one final week in Vietnam together with her family and
then I came home to make arrangements to bring my fiancé to America to
marry me.  This is ongoing as of this writing.</p>
