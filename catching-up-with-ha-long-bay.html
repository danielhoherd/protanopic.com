		<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3615598260/"><img alt="Moonrise over Ha Long" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2440/3615598260_d85b0e5002_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> I am currently sitting on the patio of my hotel
room on the 5th floor looking out over Ha Long Bay and the bridge, and
watching the moon rise above the hills on the opposing shore. I'm just
one girl and a bottle of wine short of the most romantic night ever.</p>
<p>This morning we departed for Ha Long bay and I finally realized that
when our tour guide says 8am he means wheels rolling at 8am. I always
seem to be the last one on the bus.</p>
<p>We headed out through early Hanoi traffic which seemed to flow mostly
into the city instead of out, so it wasn't busy. We stopped for tea a
long while into the drive and I was delighted to find a lot of art at
this shop. There were paintings, mosaics, and sewn images showing
traditional Vietnamese scenes, and surprisingly some showing nude female
figures. Sexuality and nudity have so far been almost completely absent
except mildly in advertisements for mobile phones and karaoke bars.
There were a group of kids sewing images by hand into canvases, a lot
like cross stitching, and it was nice to see art being made.</p>
<p>We stopped for lunch at a temple that had a gondola to take us to the
top of a mountain, except the gondola wasn't running. This was pretty
disappointing to many of us. Apparently the lore says that some king
left his country behind to come seek enlightenment, then his people
followed him and begged him to come back so he did for a while and then
left again. He built the temple at the top of the mountain. In modern
times the communist Vietnamese government owns both of the temples and
doesn't use them for religious purposes at all but rather just to make
money off of tourists like me.</p>
<p>We got back in the car and I adored my iPod as a savior from the wailing
screams of this bratty little kid that's on the tour. He hits and kicks
his parents and screams at the top of his lungs when he doesn't get his
way. I'm amazed that his mother lets him get away with it because she
seems like a strict type, but then I think he sees through her bluffing
threats of discipline. He's a fucking brat though, that's for sure, so
the music went up nice and loud. Rock and roll in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We stopped at another temple, this one used for actual religious
purposes, and I walked around taking photos of the scenes. I was mildly
scolded by a monk for setting foot inside a holy place without taking my
sandals off. I photographed 3 monks talking to a girl with a motorcycle
helmet on. I heard sounds of welding coming from below a secluded corner
of a courtyard and couldn't help thinking that I was supposed to jump
off the wall and pick the lock on the gate below, fight the fake monks
and find the secret passage down to the nanotech laboratory where evil
was being done behind a facade of Buddhism.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549978/"><img alt="Little Monks" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3609/3610549978_c39e059a2c_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 169px;" /></a> I thought twice about that and instead went off to play
with some monk kids who surrounded me laughing and saying short english
phrases, playing with my arm hair, wrapping their hands around my arms
to see how big they were, and patting my fat belly. One of the monks
talked in english with me briefly and brought me a book on Buddhism, and
then I had to go so the whole group shouted &quot;see you again!&quot; as I ran
down the steps of the temple towards the bus, last one in again.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3610549970/"><img alt="Bridge over Ha Long Bay" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2435/3610549970_5bba0d1cec_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a> We drove and drove and drove and I listened to
louder rock music. Finally we arrived in Ha Long bay opposite its
glorious side. We checked into the hotel and I stupidly tried to go make
the best of the day. I say stupidly because I was soon drenched in sweat
and nearly cheated out of money to use an elevator that goes up to this
really beautiful bridge, and later found out that you're not really
supposed to go out during the day. Apparently everybody here naps during
the day so they can stay up at night when it's cooler, which makes so
much sense I never thought an entire society would come to that
conclusion.</p>
<p>After showering my sweat away I got a beer and sat in the restaurant
mooching wifi. Other than the wifi and chatting with my brother about
his meeting me in Thailand on the 26th this was a miserable experience.
The beer was warm and the room was hot. I didn't even think to open the
windows to let the breeze in until I almost had to go for dinner. Then
dinner ended up being in the same room I had been sitting in.</p>
<p>After dinner we went down to the night market. Rows and rows of tables
piled with completely worthless shit. Worthless to me anyway.
Progressive minimalism and tourism do not see eye to eye when it comes
to the importance of physical novelties. I saw a few cool engrish shirts
though, so that was cool. The power went out just as I was crossing the
bridge to an outdoor techno club on the beach, so I stayed there at the
club and had a mango smoothie that cost approximately $1. Lot's of
things here cost approximately $1. The music was freakin awesome and I
was disappointed that nobody was dancing, or rather that there was
nobody there to dance. The place was empty, so I sat on the beach
drinking my smoothie and enjoying the techno by myself, then I began
walking home.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese guy approached me and began talking to me in good english,
though with poor pronunciation. Vietnamese people are so nice it's
almost creepy, like there's some hidden agenda. It makes it hard to
gauge who you can trust, but this guy and his group of friends were all
cool so we walked a while and they took photos with me.</p>
<p>Then I ran into two people on the tour who are Vietnamese people from
France. I walked with them, took some photos for them, and they bought
me a beer at a stall where we sat and chatted it up with the owner. I
barely understood anything they said, but they knew a little english.
Charades was part of the game, and that's always fun.</p>
<p>I came home, checked online for some friends, and came upstairs to write
in the comfort of my own room rather than in the hotel lobby. So now the
moon is higher in the sky, I may have a few additional mosquito bites,
and you know probably more details about my day than is really
necessary. I'll try to keep it shorter tomorrow...</p>
