		<p>On the morning of May 28th our alarm failed to go off, or at least we
didn't hear it, but I somehow managed to wake up about 15 minutes before
our bus arrived. We hurriedly packed and got downstairs with just a few
minutes to spare. Tien tried to find us some breakfast but the
neighborhood we were in was mostly construction type shops so she only
managed to find some snacks before the bus came and took us away.</p>
<p>There were many europeans on the bus, it was almost entirely full of
white folks. The narrow streets of Hanoi were already full of life and
packed with motorbikes. We passed by the lake where a street was closed
off for a festival that was just beginning. We stopped at a few hotels
to pick up other folks, and then stopped at the cathedral to wait for
somebody. It was at that time that Tien realized she'd forgotten her bag
at the hotel. The bag that had the iPad in it. In her typical stressed
out mode, she forgot all english and began blabbing away in Vietnamese
with the bus driver and some other folks, and didn't really say anything
to me or answer any questions. She told me to wait, and went to hail a
moto taxi. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4651816172/"><img alt="32::am::138" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4651816172_3d9be3db9b_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /></a> I chatted with a girl from The Netherlands for
about 10 minutes before Tien came back, relieved to have her bag in
hand.</p>
<p>At 9am we headed out for Ha Long City. Traffic was heavy on the way out
of Hanoi, and I noticed again how the number of cars just seemed to mess
up the flow of traffic. Tien and I drank water and ate Oreo cookies for
breakfast.</p>
<p>We passed the charred frame of a motorbike that stood up in its own
ashes as if it had immolated itself at the side of the highway, probably
protesting the rise of the cars.</p>
<p>We passed factories for Canon and Foxconn in the countryside.</p>
<p>We pulled off at a travel stop for 20 minutes. Tien and I got some
pomelo and bananas. I was hoping to find a better breakfast, but they
don't know how to make breakfast sandwiches yet in Vietnam. I could make
millions selling them... Millions of Dong.</p>
<p>We passed a few auto accidents along the way to Ha Long, one involving a
motorbike and one where a car had driven up the side embankment and
crashed into a pole, finishing sideways, squished between the pole and
the hillside. It was a remarkable sight, I'm not sure if anybody died,
but it looked like they should have but didn't.</p>
<p>Soon after the car crash we arrived at the outskirts of Ha Long City
where the bus dropped us off at the docks. Tien and I were the only two
folks on the bus left who weren't going on the cruise, and it felt kinda
nice to be sitting there with just the two of us, ready to do whatever
we felt like, far away from obligation. The tour guide from the group
came over and asked us if we wanted to go on their boat to Cat Ba
Island, which is precisely where Tien and I were headed, so we agreed to
take their tour for 250k each. It was expensive for a boat ride, but
included the Ha Long Bay tour, dinner and a cave tour, so it was a
pretty good deal.</p>
<p>The boat we boarded was a typical asian junk. Ours had three levels:
rooms downstairs, a dining room in the middle and an upper deck. Dinner
was served shortly after taking off. Tien and I sat and chatted with
some other travelers and it was good to be back in the company of
english speaking, active people. Only one of them was from America, the
rest were brits, french and other countries that I never learned. Tien
was the only Vietnamese person on the tour that wasn't working. She
mostly listened while I blabbed away with the brits about traveling,
culture, food, work, and destinations. One of them, a man named Paul who
we'd run into many times on the island, was traveling from London to
Australia to work. He'd been traveling for a few months and had a few
weeks left. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4707870537/"><img alt="Local transport in Ha Long Bay" class="align-right" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1270/4707870537_0f8ba5536c_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>Most other folks were just
traveling for fun, some for weeks, some for months.</p>
<p>After dinner most of us went up on the deck to take in the sights as we
approached the islands of Ha Long Bay. The boat pulled into a bay and
docked with a bunch of other junks and we all got off to explore Thien
Cung cave. It was a cool cave, but there really isn't much to see inside
most caves. There was an opportunity to go to another cave, but Tien and
I declined and instead went to take some photos and relax.</p>
<p>Everybody returned to the boat and we traveled onwards, through the
islands and into a market area where there were many floating houses
that were used as a fish market and other business related things. There
were girls floating around on boats with their fruit all laid out for
sale. They paddled up next to us and shouted out, sounding like retarded
people with a heavy lisp, saying &quot;eck-u me, pine-appo&quot; and things like
that. It was cute, and their boats were beautiful with the colored
fruit, but Tien and I already had some fruits we'd bought earlier so we
didn't buy anything. Instead, we decided to go with a small group on a
little tour of an enclosed part of the bay, completely surrounded by
cliffs, almost like a lake except it was salt water. We took a small
local boat in and a few of us swam around for a while before returning
through another natural tunnel.</p>
<p>A short rest on the boat later we were pulling up to Cat Ba Island,
which looked like a pretty treacherous place, and seemed like it would
be more than one island. Indeed it would be if the water were deeper,
the landscape rose and fell just like the islands sticking out of the
water, but came down to land at the bottom.</p>
<p>Anybody who wasn't sleeping on the boat was dropped off on the island.
We were, once again, dropped on the completely opposite side of the
island from the town. Tien managed to negotiate some kind of bus ride,
still with the tour, and after sitting for 10 minutes or so a group of
us got in and headed over the crazy terrain.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4651760502/"><img alt="Cat Ba backroads" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4651760502_22eebcae7d_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>There was one sign at the front of the bus, and it
was written in Korean. I'm sure nobody on the bus knew what it said. The
ride took 30 minutes and we passed by many, many beautiful views. The
steep hills fell down to flat fields where different foods were grown,
some ponds and rivers, and countless steep hills. On top of one of the
hills was a tower standing tall, and I made a joke about climbing up it.
A lot of other people were blabbing away in their native languages, and
a group behind us was chatting in english about their travels.</p>
<p>As we pulled into town, Paul and some of the folks he was talking to
were trying to find a hotel in the guide book. We all got out right at
the main intersection of the town, and after looking at one hotel that
had no vacancy I decided Tien and I would probably be better off walking
around trying to find a hotel. We went one block and found a place where
we negotiated with a slimy guy who I didn't like much. Tien said she
also didn't like him much because of some things he did or said that
showed he looked down on her. The hotel room actually kinda sucked too,
no AC, no internet, and a bed wrapped in plastic with a tiny blanket.</p>
<p>We took a short rest and then went out for dinner. There were a lot of
people riding tandem bicycles around and we thought about getting one,
but decided to do it another day. Instead we returned home and fell
asleep. Some time during the night, Tien got up and found some towels to
use as blankets. The next morning we woke up and the power was out.
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4651222083/"><img alt="32::AM::139" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4651222083_c9d298ff18_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a> It was a dreary morning. We decided to find a new hotel.</p>
<p>Finding a hotel has become much easier now that I know to use my iPhone
to do it. I don't look it up online, that's pretty tough over here where
there are no centralized review sites like yelp. Instead, I go into the
network settings and look for wifi hotspots with hotel names, then I go
to that hotel. Any hotel who has wifi that my iPhone can find from the
street has got to be good. The only downside to this is that sometimes
these hotels are expensive, but at least it helps weed out the crummy
places.</p>
<p>We walked out to the end of the pier that stuck into the bay where
dozens of boats were docked. Some were fishing boats, some were floating
hotels, some were restaurants. It was a good way to get a view of the
shops that went along the waterfront.</p>
<p>We had a disappointing breakfast in a restaurant that seemed like it was
closed. I was getting tired of fake coffee. One great thing though was
we invented a new food. It's the stir fried beef and noodle egg
breakfast sandwich. Tien orders stir fried beef and noodles, I order egg
with bread. I put the egg in the bread with some soy sauce, and she puts
some beef and noodles in with it. It is *so* delicious, I've been
eating it frequently ever since.</p>
<p>We went back to a place we saw the previous night while walking around
looking for dinner. It was a hotel that was built into the rock cliff.
There was a big room with two beds available for not much money, and we
took it. We didn't need the second bed, but it's nice to lay things out
on when you're organizing, and for lazing around on like a couch.<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4651760508/"><img alt="Tien and the bike at Cat Ba" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4651760508_cd329337c3_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> So, we spent the mid day heat being lazy at our
hotel room.</p>
<p>We went to rent a tandem bicycle, but the prices were like 20k for 1
hour. A motorbike was as low as 60k a day. We had already paid the girl
before we knew it was per hour, and I finally decided to let her keep
the damn bike and the money because we didn't need a bike for an hour.
She finally gave my money back as I was walking away. Instead of a bike,
we decided to get a moto from our hotel though, for 100k a day.</p>
<p>We cruised some local beaches and then headed northwest on the island
into territory we hadn't seen yet. We found a place where they were
filling in a bay with mud to build a golf course. Beyond that there were
beautiful, natural places, some caves, farming villages, roaming goats,
and eventually a beautiful pink sunset. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4654745710/"><img alt="Finding the rural Cat Ba" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4654745710_a90b88e90d_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a>We
stopped a lot along the way and took photos, and at sunset we decided to
speed back to the town to go swimming at the Cat Co 2 beach.
Unfortunately, by the time we got there the water was off limits, so we
sat and had some drinks on the beach instead. I dipped my feet in the
water and was suddenly not disappointed that I couldn't go in, the water
was cold. Too cold to enjoy a swim in, that's for sure. It was a huge
difference from the beautiful, clear, warm waters of Phu Quoc. Instead
of sticking around, we headed back to town to get dinner at an awesome
spot on the water front called Bamboo. It was recommended in the
guidebook, but also looked appealing. The staff was nice and the food
was great, and it was a very satisfying end to the day.</p>
