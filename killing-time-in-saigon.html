		<p>On Monday, Tien and I decided to find a new breakfast place. We walked
several blocks through the heart of the tourist area at Pham Ngu Lao and
found a lot of places that looked overpriced and inauthentic. I honestly
don't like things to be too touristy, so when I see people with color
t-shirts from the cities they have visited sitting at a fancy looking
restaurant where all the seats face the street, I shy away. We walked
down a block with big business offices and came upon a fancy cafe with
about 20 motorbikes out front and knew it must be good. This is how I am
going to gauge restaurants from now on, by how many motorbikes are out
front. If there are few it's either bad food or for tourists.</p>
<p>After breakfast we again we went looking for meds and found nothing.
Tien said she'd call her friend who is a doctor and ask him about it. We
walked and talked and went and had smoothies. We, or rather I, talked a
lot about music and culture and how I feel like VN is prime for an
alternative culture to thrive. I feel like there is a lot of artistic
talent here that has no direction and is still tied to the traditions of
the culture, and that if there was a cultural icon who broke away from
that tradition it would have a huge effect on the direction of the next
generations. Music and visual art were my two main points of
illustration. The fact that there is no alternative music to speak of
and no graffiti in Saigon demonstrate the ties to cultural traditions.</p>
<p>We headed back to the hotel room and did some research online about
pharmacies and malaria. I was horrified by the stories of people on
Lariam (Mefloquine). The photos and story of the Somalia Affair were
enough for me to stay away from that med. Malarone was probably out of
the question, but I did find doxycycline and that looked very promising.
What was even more promising was learning that Vietnam doesn't even have
much of a malaria problem to begin with, and that's why it's so hard to
find anti-malarials. Apparently there is only a problem with malaria in
the high regions surrounding Laos, and one remote forested region down
south. Tien's doctor friend said this and I didn't believe it at first,
but I found malaria maps online to back it up. I wondered about the
american medical system...</p>
<p>Again I napped, and again it was too long. I've decided to call off
afternoon naps at all costs until I get my sleep schedule well in order.
Tien and I woke up just after sunset and went to have dinner. We had
pho, and we played a word game that I played with Lila's son Maks in the
car on the way to the airport where you find a word that begins with the
last letter of the previous word. Car, Road, Dream, Mellon, Nearby. This
was a fun game to play for the word association aspect of it and for the
vocabulary aspect for Tien.</p>
<p>After dinner we wandered back to a pirate DVD and Book store we found on
my last trip, got some movies. We ate smoothies on the way back to the
hotel, then stayed up late watching Minority Report on my laptop.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Tien and I went back to coffee viva for breakfast. We sat in
the back next to a bronze statue of a topless girl reclining and arching
her back. There was supposed to be a fountain or pond, but it was dry
and smelled like fish so we moved. Over breakfast we talked about things
we could do on this trip. We considered Ha Tien Beach, Ha Long Bay since
she had never been there and Nha Trang since I had never been there.
Other countries were also considered but Laos was ruled out with the
highlands of Vietnam because of malaria. We also talked about getting me
a motorbike license back in Long Xuyen.</p>
<p>On the way back to the hotel we stopped at a motorbike rental shop and
looked at prices. It was $6 a day including helmets, which sounded
really appealing. We decided to go plan more at the hotel and come back
when we needed the bike. We picked up a pizza for an afternoon snack and
went to a park by the hotel to look for a geocache. We found where the
cache was but decided not to get it in the broad daylight because of the
muggles. Instead we went to the hotel and chilled out for a while and
ate our pizza. Tien called her old teacher Tyler about hanging out with
him but he was busy that evening. I heard back from David that he was
back from Singapore but was sick. He was resting for the rest of the day
and would let me know if he was feeling better the next day. So, with
nowhere to go we decided to nap.</p>
<p>We went out to walk around at dinnertime and had trouble agreeing on a
restaurant. Tien eventually pointed to a decent looking place that was
Australian themed. I got a big Saigon Red beer and some beef with rice.
It was absolutely delicious at first bite, then I was hit by the MSG
train. It wasn't a hint, it was obvious. Fortunately it was in the sauce
and I was able to eat a lot of the rice and other tasty bits without it
tasting too bad, but my mouth was still tingly afterwards. Tien's mixed
fried rice wasn't too bad, but I directed us to our now usual smoothie
spot for after MSG cleansing. The smoothie shop was conveniently right
across from the geocache, which is now the only cache in Saigon. We
found it quickly, took a trackable and went back to the hotel. We put on
Harry Potter and the half blood prince but fell asleep about thirty
minutes in, not because it was a bad movie.</p>
