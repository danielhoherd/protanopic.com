		<p>May 30th was another rainy morning on Cat Ba Island. My hair was getting
longer than I liked so I decided to shave my head, but when I went to
use my electric razor the battery was practically dead. To top it off, I
soon found out I had killed the charger by plugging it into a 220v
outlet that it was not made for. So long, electric device, another
casualty of world travel.</p>
<p>Tien and I decided to go after the only geocache on the Island which was
located somewhere in the center of the island. I tried to find a good
map of the island but couldn't, and the topo maps available via the
Geocaching iPhone app were pretty poor. This sucked because the iPhone's
assisted (aka, retarded) GPS doesn't work unless you have cell
reception, which I do not since my phone is locked to AT&amp;T's network.
With that in mind I read all of the hints and logs, and found out that
the geocache was located at the bottom of the very tower I had joked
about climbing to the top of, on top of Ngu Lam Peak.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4717569796/"><img alt="Hiking the wrong trail" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4717569796_c1ae01a8d2_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 66px;" /></a>We mounted our moto and headed out for the
park where the trailhead was. Unfortunately I was thinking like a n00b
and totally forgot to bring food and water. On top of that, we ended up
on the wrong trail, one that went up and down steep rocks through deep
jungle. There were a lot of butterflies and some animals in the forest
making some crazy sounds like a digeridoo. Eventually we ran into some
folks who were coming the other way down the trail and when Tien asked
them if we were headed towards the tower they said no. They told us
where the right trail was, we hadn't taken the right exit off the main
road. We turned around and headed back to the bike, hiking about half
the way with the other party.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4717426514/"><img alt="Looking up to Ngu Lam Peak" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4717426514_5fec5ac645_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 70px;" /></a>Once we got back to the main road, where
we were in clear view of our destination, we turned towards home and
immediately passed a huge gate with people selling food and
refreshments. It was the gateway to the right trail. I made a joke about
going to climb it, not really being serious because our energy had been
pretty spent on the wrong trail and we still hadn't eaten anything. Tien
said she was up for the hike though, and with several verifications that
she was serious we parked our bike and got some refreshments. The sun
had just come out, having been hidden behind a nice layer of low clouds
all morning, so we walked for a short while in the sun before
disappearing back into the jungle and up a steep incline of steps.</p>
<p>A little ways up the trail was a sign that was pretty confusing, but we
figured out that it basically said &quot;left is the shorter hard way, right
is the longer easy way.&quot; We went left into what was hardly recognizable
as a trail. Muddy rocks, frogs, butterflies, crazy vines and deep jungle
going up steep, jagged rocks. We encountered two girls who were coming
down and talked to them a little bit about what was up ahead. They said
it was a lot of the same, and since it was manageable we continued. It
soon became much less steep and merged back with the easy trail.</p>
<p>I found a blue gorilla pod that was placed on a rock on display,
probably put there by the girls to be easy to spot by whoever lost it. I
figured this was a bad idea so I took it and hung it from my backpack,
expecting better chances of running into the owner along the trail, but
never found them.</p>
<p>One thing that was odd was that there were crabs running around on the
rocks. I had seen a few on the previous trail too and thought it was
odd, I'd never seen crabs anywhere away from the ocean, and this was
far, far from the ocean.</p>
<p>We ascended a few metal ladders that were bolted onto some steep rocks
and peeked out of the forest to see a grand view of the island and its
many steep hill tops. I recalled that the cache hints had said it was
near that spot, so I consulted them and we doubled back to look for it.
It was easy to find once we were in the right spot. There was a travel
bug inside of it that had been there for two months, so even though I
had nothing to leave, I took the TB to remove it from its exile. It
wanted to visit zoos, so I made the plan to take it to Cheyenne Mountain
Zoo, almost on the exact opposite side of the planet.</p>
<p>With our objective complete, Tien and I continued the short distance to
the top of the hill where the tower was. It was a rusty metal tower from
the war in the 60's. It hadn't been noticeably repaired, and there was a
sign indicating that it wasn't safe for more than 4 people. While Tien
and I were at the cache a european couple passed us, and now they were
up on the tower, so that made four of us.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4656061067/"><img alt="Looking down from Ngu Lam Tower" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4656061067_645f4d847f_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 64px;" /></a>Tien and I started up the stairs that
circled around the core of the tower, but her acrophobia kicked in and
she got pretty scared and by the second landing she said she was too
scared to continue. I was certainly not going to force her to climb this
scary spectacle, but I myself was not about to back down, so I left her
there knowing she could make it back down on her own as I continued to
the top. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4716872437/"><img alt="Tien and I at the top of Ngu Lam Tower" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4716872437_faaf738e01_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 63px;" /></a> When I got to the top
the european couple was up there admiring the scenery, which was
incredible. It looked like an unrealistic landscape that some novice
would make in Bryce 3d. I exchanged photo taking duties with the couple,
and right as they were finishing taking my photo Tien appeared on the
stairs, she had overcome her fears and made it to the top. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4654745716/"><img alt="Looking out over Cat Ba Island" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/4654745716_8e44267fa2_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 41px;" /></a> They took some photos of the two of us, and I took
some panorama and HDR sets, admired the view with my own eyes, and then
we started down. Just as we were starting down, the european man
remarked about how he was a structural engineer and seeing the state of
the rusty metal made him want to get off the tower as quickly as
possible because it was not safe. It was at that brittle stage of rusty,
where you can break off parts of the metal. They went quicker down the
stairs than Tien and I did, <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4658077441/"><img alt="Down the tower" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4658077441_a8925f6c7f_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 66px;" /></a>and I let Tien go ahead of
me so we weren't all on the same stairwell, spacing out our weight so as
to not overbear this artifact.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4654247455/"><img alt="Below a rusty tower" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4654247455_c7b4f82a03_t.jpg" style="width: 66px; height: 100px;" /></a>When Tien and I got to the bottom we were all
alone again. We had some snacks from the gateway at the bottom, so we
took a break to eat bananas, drink a coke, and clean out the potato
chips that had spilled in our bag. Everything that was in the bag now
smelled like imitation crab. Who ever heard of crab flavored pringles?</p>
<p>While we were eating, Tien and I talked about adventuring. She said this
was the first time she had ever done this sort of thing, and I was proud
of her. Not only did she do it, she did it after having taken the wrong
trail where we had no food, farther from her home than she'd ever been
before on and island with steep rocky terrain through a dense jungle
crawling with crabs.</p>
<p>Just as we started down we ran into a group of young adventurers who had
come up the easy way. We checked with them how to get there, and once we
found it it ended up not being too much easier than the hard way. Sure
it wasn't as steep, but it had rusty metal handrails that had broken
apart and become javelins waiting to impale you if you slipped on the
muddy rocks. Tien did slip, and thankfully she did not impale herself,
but she broke the band of her engagement ring in half when she caught it
on a sharp rock. I was glad she hadn't cut herself open in the process,
but we were definitely going to have to get it fixed. The rest of the
way down was easier than I expected, given the terrain, and at the
bottom was a man with a shop and a deep well where he drew buckets of
cold fresh water for us. We bought ice cream, water and beer and relaxed
before plodding back to our motorbike.</p>
<p>On the way back was Hospital Cave, a cave that had been converted into a
secret hospital for troops during the war. I really wanted to see what
it was like, but after two trails we were dead tired so we skipped it.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4659229174/"><img alt="Autoswimmers" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4659229174_c461887647_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 75px;" /></a>Back at the hotel I took a shower to wash off the
buckets of sweat and caked mud on my legs, then we headed back to Cat Co
2 for a swim to cool down our muscles. The water was a bit chilly, but
worse than that, it was really dirty. There was trash of plastic and
organic kinds floating in the water all along the beach. I thought about
the clear, warm water of Phu Quoc and wished we were back at Bai Sao. We
took some photos and left, this Cat Co thing was not our idea of fun.
Instead we went back to Bamboo and had dinner while most of the island
was without power. It was funny to see the mainland all dark while the
floating restaurants and hotels in the bay were all lit up, powered by
their boat motors.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4716770843/"><img alt="Child Cyclo" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4716770843_34edbfd456_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 75px;" /></a>There was a boy riding a child-size cyclo up and down the
street giving other kids rides.</p>
<p>A few kids came riding by on bikes emblazoned with the word &quot;exercise.&quot;</p>
<p>Back at the hotel we went upstairs, realized we'd forgotten the key at
the front desk, and on my way down to get it I slipped and fell on the
stone stairwell, bruising both of my forearms.</p>
<p>The silence and whir of the fan told us how the power flickered on and
off all night long</p>
