		<p>Since I haven't been traveling, it's been a long time since I've
actually written on my blog.  Right now I'm sitting on my front steps in
Chinatown, SF, sipping on cognac and waiting for my wife to come home
with the key to our front door.</p>
<p>I've been working back at GWOS where I was contracting before my last
trip to Asia.  Tien is going to cosmetology school here in SF and we're
waiting and waiting on immigration to give Tien a green card.  Contrary
to what I believed, getting married does not solve any immigration
problems.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about life and about traveling lately,
comparing my-our current situation to what it was like last year.  This
time last year Tien and I had just arrived back in Binh Hoa from a trip
to Da Lat.  It was still my second trip.  Near the equator the daylight
does not go away in the winter time, and in Vietnam there is no daylight
savings time darkening your evenings. I can't imagine why on earth they
call it daylight <em>savings</em> time when it takes your daylight away...</p>
<p>As for photography, it's been a little tough to remember to photograph
things every day. The life of a technologist is not the life of a
photographer, only one can be primary. Logical thought and art use two
separate parts of the brain, and creativity in the visual, optical sense
has almost nothing to do with the abstract, logical sense. I must admit,
I've cheated on my 365 project twice this year... thanks to my
technologist side, nobody will ever know which days I cheated on, as
I've fixed my exif data.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to traveling again, anywhere, but for now it's time
to sit tight, save money and let things that need to be accomplished be
accomplished.  Tien needs to finish school, immigration needs to do its
thing, and the holidays.. oh the holidays. I want to say that winter
needs to get the hell out of the way, but I know that if I just sit back
and enjoy it then I may actually have a good time.  Luckily for me, San
Francisco winters are warmer than the summers, if not a bit more wet.</p>
<p>On the topic of travel, since Tien is technically in the country
illegally since her visa has expired and the US has no (to my knowledge)
intermediary status between on a fiancé visa and legal resident, we
can't really travel outside the country. This is one of the many
problems with immigration... they say it's legal if you're here as long
as you've filed your paperwork, but there's nothing to <em>show</em> that
you've filed your paperwork, so as far as anybody knows she's illegal.
Anyhow, we can't travel outside the country, and it's risky even
traveling inside the country. When we do travel inside the country I
have a few places lined up...</p>
<p>I want to visit Hawaii.  I've never been there even though everybody I
know has told me to go there.  It's beautiful, the ocean is warm, it's a
photographers dream.  To top it off, I have a friend or two there who
wants to show me the local spots.  Sounds great!  Line that up for 2011.</p>
<p>I want to visit NYC.  I've always wanted to.  Last time I had a plan to
do so was just before 9/11.  In fact, my travel arrangements to the east
coast were on 9/18, the first day you were allowed to fly after 9/11.
Needless to say, I canceled my plans to visit NYC and stuck to the easy
stuff, although a 6,000 mile drive home wasn't exactly easy, even
without the thieves and luggage rack coming undone on the freeway.  So,
I've never been there but I'd love to go.  I have a few friends who live
there, and a few friends in the not so nearby cities like DC and Boston,
which means NYC deserves a good chunk of time above the good chunk of
time that NYC already deserves.</p>
<p>I want to visit Alaska again.  It'll be my third time, Tien's first.
Alaska is breathtakingly beautiful.  Just gorgeous.  My aunt lives up
there and I fully plan on visiting her next summer during the solstice,
which is a photographers dream come true.  The sun goes across the sky
at a severe angle, never straight above, which leads to hours upon hours
of evening and morning light conditions.  The landscape is wonderful,
the weather is wonderful, the people are wonderful, the outdoors are
wonderful.  Can't wait to get back to Alaska...</p>
<p>Which brings me to a slight digression from domestic travel... I met My
while I was in Alaska, an her family graciously hosted me while I was in
Thailand.  I regret not having spent more time there... My schedule
wasn't planned, I never knew where I'd be from day to day, and I skipped
out early on Thailand to spend a few days in Laos before returning to
Vietnam, staying for a few weeks and flying off to Malaysia for a week.
I *seriously* need to revisit Malaysia, Thailand and Laos, in that
order, proceeding on to Sapa and the rest of northern Vietnam.  Maybe
even stop off in Burma for a while...</p>
<p>So, back to domestic travel, there are a few other places I'd like to go
that I've never been.  Mt. Rushmore, The Grand Canyon, Florida, even
Yosimite for heaven's sake.  Hmm.... Maybe I should drive there this
weekend or so... before selling the car, of course.  Tien and I bought a
scooter and it's wicked cool for getting around the city.</p>
<p>And of course, back to Colorado for the holidays.  That's the next plan,
with a possible jaunt down to San Diego for Thanksgiving.  We'll see...
But just writing about my travels has perked me up.  And of course the
cognac had something to do with it, I'm sure... But I do miss traveling,
and I do miss SE Asia and the warm weather.  On the cold days, I dream
of floating in the Bai Sao waters where it was hard to find a spot cool
enough to swim.  I look at those photos and wonder what on earth I'm
doing in dark, cold San Francisco...</p>
