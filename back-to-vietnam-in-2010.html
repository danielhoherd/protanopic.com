		<p>Friday, May 7th was my last day working my contract at GWOS. I had
thought my contract ended a week earlier, and had bought a plane ticket
for that timeframe. That detail was an oversight on my part, and it cost
me nearly the price of a plane ticket just to get it switched. Honestly
though I was happy to work the extra week because projects were coming
together and I got a lot of work done that week. My boss Dr. Dave Blunt
was on vacation in New Zealand, so on Friday I trained a temp guy to
pick up some of the slack while another co-worker, Thomas Stocking, was
going to be handling the bulk of the IT duties. A few of my co-workers
invited me into Thomas's office for a glass of fine scotch to finish the
work day off.</p>
<p>After work I got in my car and headed to REI to pick up a hat and a
light colored, long sleeved shirt, two things that are priceless in SE
Asia.  I didn't immediately notice that the hat, like my backpack I'd
bought for my first trip, was made in Vietnam.</p>
<p>For dinner I grabbed sushi with Blake and Lily on Castro St, and after
that I drove down to Lila's house to stay with her family for a while. I
spent a lot of time there playing on the iPad with Maks and trying to
find the best way to pack some gifts for my trip. The best way ended up
being to keep my expensive and fragile things in my backpack while
putting heavy and liquid things into a cardboard box for check-in at the
airport.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4598499500/"><img alt="32::AM::118" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3361/4598499500_122e579255_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /></a>The How Weird Street Faire was on Mother's day, which was
Sunday, and I had planned to go but ended up not being able to make it.
That's my favorite SF electronica festival, but it just wasn't going to
fit into my schedule and it wasn't high enough priority for me to really
make it happen. Getting packed for my trip and making sure I had
everything I needed was my main focus the last few days. Late Sunday
night Lila and Maks dropped me off at SFO. Check in was easy, but the
last bar closed at 11pm and I was just a few minutes too late to get any
service, so I ended up waiting at the gate, tired but trying to stay
awake for the last few hours.</p>
<p>Just after 1am on May 10th, China Airlines flight 3 from SFO to Taipei
boarded, and it would be the most uncomfortable international flight I'd
ever taken. The plane was shoddy, the seat was uncomfortable, the food
was bad, there were crying babies, there was what seemed like a VHS tape
hooked to a 1990's projection style TV for us to watch a movie on, and
no personal entertainment systems on each chair (which was fine by me
anyway, those things all suck.) On top of that, I had an aisle seat so
people kept running by and brushing my arm or leaning against me to let
other people pass.</p>
<p>I slept for most of the flight. I thought about watching a movie on my
iPad, or listening in on the in-flight movie, but remembered that it is
disconnecting and weird to lose myself in a fictitious plot when I've
got my own new story going.</p>
<p>I remembered that I'd forgotten to pick up a travel bug to take to Asia.
Oh well. Next time.</p>
<p>One good thing I'll say is that the coffee was good. I think I like
Asian coffee more than what we usually get in America. I'd have traded
the better than average coffee for a comfortable seat though.</p>
<p>The in-flight GPS display came up on the big screen and showed that we
had just flown over almost all of Japan. It then switched to a display
of &quot;breathing exercises for relaxation&quot; where a girl was sitting calmly
on a chair at the end of a dock on a mirror lake with what looked like
Mt. Fuji in the background, though I suspect it was some Chinese
mountain. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4608238086/"><img alt="32::AM::120 - 45 minutes at the Taipei Airport" class="align-right" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1185/4608238086_37abe984ac_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /></a>The video
had just begun to explain to us how to relax when the girl was torn from
her serene location by static and color glitches commonly seen when you
pause a VHS tape. The captain had an announcement.</p>
<p>We landed in an overcast Taipei that was mostly unremarkable. What I
could see of the airport outside was foreign and neat, but beyond it was
just familiar green vegetation and grey skies. I spent no more than 45
minutes there before being seated on flight CI0781 to Saigon. Maybe I'll
go back for a longer visit some day...</p>
