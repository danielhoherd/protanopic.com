		<p>Yesterday morning I was greeted by a large spider on the floor of my
hotel room. Mai showed up shortly afterwards and brought me back to
their house where we ate and talked and showered.</p>
<p>We eat frequently here, though not a lot. There are 8 females in this
house and it seems like every time I turn around one of them is offering
me a fruit or giving me a drink or telling me to sit down while they
point the fan where I should sit. It's a little overwhelming because I
don't really know how to respond. I feel so indebted to Tien's family
but I don't know how to repay them. They won't even let me pay for
things.</p>
<p>After I showered, Mai, Tien, their mom and I piled onto two scooters and
rode for a few hours to Câm Mountain.<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3591194324/"><img alt="Vietnam Cruisin' 2009" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3591194324_2d1d5b9a66_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a></p>
<p>I saw two girls sharing a bicycle. The one in front pedaled while the
girl in back upshed off the ground, then when they got moving they both
put their feet on the pedals side by side and pedaled off together.</p>
<p>I saw a white guy riding a bicycle and it was really odd.</p>
<p>We came across a boat race on the Hâu river while we were on our way to
Câm Mountain. We rode along next to this river for a long time. The road
was on a burm between two waterways that irrigated rice paddies. The
rice paddies were some of the most beautiful sights I'd seen, so green
and stretching on to the horizon with geometric lines running through
them and flags placed here and there. The paddies were only visible
through the gaps between shacks built off of the burm, standing up on
stilts. These were some of the most poor shelters I've ever seen. Tin
shacks on wooden stilts with wooden floors. Some had docks going down
towards the water where people could board boats.</p>
<p>There were lots of boats. We passed a ship yard where people were
welding together barge type boats. There were hand-powered boats that
you'd row or push with a stick. There were boats with long outboard
motors. There were wooden foot-bridges that rose up over the river in a
large arc that was too steep for most bicyclists to bike over, but not
too steep or weak for somebody to ride over on a scooter.</p>
<p>I tell you, Vietnam is all about scooters. Tien says you have to be 18
to ride a motorbike, but it doesn't seem that way. People go to street
fares and never get off their scooters. They sit on them like they're
chairs while they watch live performances on a stage in the center of a
wide boulevard. They wait outside of to-go restaurants and the employees
bring the food out to you on a scooter. They watched the boat race and
never got off their scooters. They love their scooters. They wash them
all the time. I even saw a guy washing his scooter wheels using the
muddy water of a puddle at the side of the road.</p>
<p>We stopped in a town called Châu Dôc and went to a Budhist temple where
we ate lychees and Tien's family prayed. The other women at the temple
loved this blue accented straw hat I was wearing and wanted to try it
on.</p>
<p>I saw chickens eating fruit that looked like a coconut.</p>
<p>We rode some distance more until we got to the foot of the mountain
where we found a local shop to watch our scooters. People never leave
their scooters unattended. Part of going to a restaurant is that they
watch your scooter and will park it for you if needed. This usually
involves putting it in neutral and rolling it up tightly next to another
scooter.</p>
<p>We had originally intended to hike up the mountain but it was getting
late, so instead we hired 4 guides to give us a motorcycle tour of the
mountain and the temple at the top. It was a steep ride up the mountain,
15% grade in some parts (thankfully grade signs are universal.) We rode
over dirt and cobble stone sidewalks right next to vendors where people
were walking until we got to this huge statue of Buddha where people
were praying and vendors were selling incense and kids were plaing with
toy laser guns that made irreverent noises.</p>
<p>Afterwards we went around a lake to the temple which had a large pagoda
and two small ones next to it. One of the great things about temples is
that street vendors can't go onto the temple property, which keeps them
quiet and calm and peaceful. It's an amazing difference from the beeping
of scooters, zapping of toy laser guns, jabbering of street vendors,
etc..</p>
<p>Somehow Tien's mom managed to get one of the monks to unlock the 8 story
tall pagoda and walk with us up to the top. Tien and Mai stopped at each
level to pray, and I was allowed to take photos, unlike in the temple
where I wasn't allowed to take photos or even go inside. The view from
the pagoda was really great. It was hard for me to show how excited I
was without being irreverent, and it ended up coming off as me being
unimpressed, so I had to make up for it when we got back to the bottom
by talking on and on about how beautiful it was. And it really was
awesome.</p>
<p>One of the things I've gotten used to is attention. I've only seen 4
white people in Vietnam so far. Everybody turns their head as you pass,
and some shout out &quot;hello!&quot; and wave to you. Some just say &quot;oi!&quot; At the
bottom of the pagoda there was a guy with his family who I had seen at
the Buddha. This guy, maybe a high school student, was unabashedly
taking a photo of me with his cell phone, moving so that he was always
in front of me. I posed and joked at him for taking too long, but I'm
sure he didn't understand a word of what I said. His family all laughed
and smiled and we all thought it was pretty funny. People here love my
light eyes, straight nose and my dimples. As we were leaving they said
&quot;Goodbye! See you later!&quot; which I thought was pretty funny since I would
almost certainly not see them later.</p>
<p>We took a quick stop off at another small temple they were building at
the side of the lake. This quick stop involved riding down a dirt trail
and over a bridge with two large humps in it, then through a sparse
forest up to the foot of the temple. There were vendors beyond the
safety of the temple property, one was selling some kind of rodent,
maybe a furry kind of mouse or a squirrel, in tiny cages. After this we
headed down the steep mountain and wound up at the bottom reclining in
hammocks eating lychees and relaxing.</p>
<p>We piled back on our scooters and headed the 75km or so back home. Mai
and I listened to music, the sun set over the rice paddies, people were
out on the roads relaxing and watching the traffic, all turning their
heads at me and saying &quot;hello&quot; from time to time. We didn't get home
until after a dark ride down what was basically a sidewalk that
supported two-way foot, bicycle and scooter traffic through into the
town where Tien lives.</p>
<p>I stayed at their place last night. It rained like a monsoon in the
middle of the night. I awoke to the now familiar sounds of Vietnam:
scooter and truck horns.</p>
<p>Today I need to figure out where I'll be going next... It's been
difficult because Tien wont' be coming with me, so we have to find
places where people will speak english. I'm thinking about taking a 4
day trip to Ha Long Bay, then maybe going to Singapore instead of up
through Cambodia and Lao. This language thing sucks... where is Mandarax
when you need it?</p>
