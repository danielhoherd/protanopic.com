		<p>Well, my site has gone through a massive transformation so I thought I'd write
a bit about it, seeing as how I wrote about it back in 2009 when I was first
putting it up on Wordpress. Over the years I found myself disabling several of
the dynamic features like page comments. I was also <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2010/07/understanding-and-cleaning-the-pharma-hack-on-wordpress.html">hacked</a> with an attack that
stored the exploit inside of the database. This was an interesting attack
because my page appeared fine to everybody except google bots. I also found
that doing mass modifications of posts was difficult using the wordpress UI. To
work around this I thought I might look into using the Wordpress API, but by
this time I was pretty much done wanting to write PHP. The web host that I had
been using for over 10 years had been slowly reducing its features and had
passed a point where it was worth paying for. So, during a Yelp hackathon in
November 2016 I migrated all of my old wordpress content to Pelican, a static
blogging engine written in Python. I moved hosting of my site from my old VPS
to Github Pages. So far it's been working out great. I've lost the ability to
write server-side dynamic features, which is something I didn't really care
about doing, but I've also lost the ability to get hacked through my db, and
gained the ability to make changes en masse using familiar filesystem level
tools like sed and whatnot. I can track changes in git, which is also very
familiar and integrates with many things. All in all I'd say this is a nearly
perfect win. The only thing I really miss is having a remote shell available
from not my house and not my work. I'm sure if I ever need one I can easily
spin up an EC2 or Digital Ocean instance to handle my needs better than my old
VPS was.</p>
