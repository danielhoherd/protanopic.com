I'm
currently living at 425 Green Street on Telegraph Hill, but will be
returning to Vietnam to be with Tien in two weeks. Before I get into the
present and future, I should probably dive into what's been going on
since I got back to America.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4453552460/"><img alt="Look Ma, no hands!" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4036/4453552460_c266b64a9c_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 63px;" /></a>When I got back from Vietnam in Nov , I spent a
few days here in America, had Thanksgiving with my friends Rob and
Nicki, then drove to Colorado. The drive was tough because I was of
weather and because I was pretty tired. I even slept for several hours
in my car at the side of the road, but that didn't help much. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4139800974/"><img alt="I80 East on Donner Pass, Colorado bound" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4139800974_f462cebc0f_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 66px;" /></a> I finally arrived in Silverthorne
Colorado where my sister was spending the holiday weekend with her
husband's side of the family. We went sledding and ate leftovers and I
got to talk to a lot of people I had never met or hadn't seen in a long
time, like Tom Tonelli, Tom Burns, and Holly. I spent the night there
and left the next afternoon to continue on to Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>I got pulled over for speeding by the police in South Park. The officer
was really nice and let me go even though my California plates were
expired and I had no proof of insurance. This was an extra nice gesture
since most police were on edge this day due to an event that had
happened earlier where a man walked into a coffee shop in Washington
State and opened fire on some police officers.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4312902686/"><img alt="Me and my four nieces" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4066/4312902686_389054245a_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 64px;" /></a>I spent the next month in Colorado with friends
and family. I caught up with Jake and Rachel, who had just bought a new
house, my brother, who was now back from Iraq and out of the Army, Aimee
Rich, who I hadn't seen almost since high school, and a whole bunch of
other folks from Colorado Springs. I spent several days in Littleton
with my sister and nieces, which was great because it seems like I don't
often spend long periods of time staying with them. While I was in
Littleton I finally met up
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80651083&#64;N00/">Bridgepix</a>, a fantastic
photographer and master of HDR.</p>
<p><img alt="Dan Fava, December 2009" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2747/4179313021_7d80ca607f_s.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" /> <img alt="Helen, December 2009" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2704/4195269425_972e11960f_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 66px;" />I went to Aurora and
stayed with Dan and Cass at their place for a few days. They took me out
to a nice dinner and then to a The Clocktower Cabaret burlesque show
that was really entertaining and fun.  They also had a little get
together and my good buddy Nathan showed up and we all played the new
Super Mario Wii game, which is highly addicting. After that I met up
with an old friend Helen who is a fellow world traveler and another
person who I hadn't seen in years.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4153680719/"><img alt="Padre's 100" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2504/4153680719_666f727678_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 66px;" /></a>On December 2nd my dad called from the hospital and said
he had a tiny accident. Actually, he had had a pretty big accident
involving ice, a stairwell with no handrail, a rock shaped like a
pyramid and his head. It ended up with 100 stitches and him high as a
kite on pain killers. I went to get Jeff in my car to pick up my dad's
truck from where he left it before being carted off in an ambulance, but
on my way to pick up Jeff my car window rolled down and wouldn't roll
back up. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4191518639/"><img alt="The fun part of the day ended here" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4191518639_7d6666276d_t.jpg" style="width: 66px; height: 100px;" /></a>Cold weather and stupid
cars be damned. Luckily Jeff Foster's room mate Jeff Chamberlain is a
car mechanic and was available for an hour or so to whip my window back
into somewhat working shape.</p>
<p>On December 15th my brother and I got his car stuck in the snow by The
Crags and had to shovel snow with the police for like 8 hours, well into
the night.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4490922640/"><img alt="Emily" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2706/4490922640_79e0f8f155_s.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" /></a>On the 19th Jeff and Chelise hosted a Christmas party at their
house. I met some new folks and caught up with some old friends there.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4215436803/"><img alt="G and Missy" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2586/4215436803_c330058ca0_s.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" /></a>Since my family usually celebrates Christmas late because
it's easier to schedule, my brother and I have a tradition of going
hiking on Christmas day. We continued this tradition, meeting up with
Gerald and his girlfriend Loridna and her dog Misty.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4217580896/"><img alt="Wine Jug Lamp" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2749/4217580896_f7a37eb0ae_t.jpg" style="width: 73px; height: 100px;" /></a>I actually had way too much free time on my trip. The
weather was terrible and I had continual schedule conflicts with people.
I worked on some projects like the christmas light wine bottle lamps for
gifts and some whitebox product style photography. Christmas was fun.
Tien joined my family over Skype from Vietnam since she was still in
Vietnam.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4404975556/"><img alt="Upside Donner" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2679/4404975556_8941098420_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 53px;" /></a>On the 28th I headed out of town for that long drive
back to San Francisco. It's funny how the details of such a long drive
can disappear completely. I do remember sleeping in my car in the middle
of a snow storm in the middle of nowhere. I also remember getting to
Donner Pass and being refused passage because I had no snow tires or
chains, so I had to wait for a few hours for the weather to get better.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4236624598/"><img alt="Forista" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2520/4236624598_5599ed4be8_s.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" /></a>When I got back to San Francisco I headed to BLT's place and
met up with Donna, who happened to be in town.  I spent the next month
and a half there, subletting a room from Brianna who was trying to save
money. Blake's buddy Scotty was in from Denver and we hung out for most
of New Years Eve, but I ended up retiring early this year.<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4294021859/"><img alt="Terresina Polizzi, January 2010" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2740/4294021859_f4b3b9beb6_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 81px;" /></a></p>
<p>I spent most of January trying to figure out how to get my photography
rolling on a serious, profitable path. I did some marketing work for
Tara at GroundWork, but other than that it was all charity work and
portfolio building with Terresina.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4255664894/"><img alt="Wil Sinclair" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2783/4255664894_dbef80bd5c_s.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" /></a>For the second half of Feb Lila and Wil let me stay with
them, which is always wonderful. I was running short on cash and needed
to make some money quickly. I hadn't had a steady job in 9 months.
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4391901362/"><img alt="Julian Ostrow on the guitar" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4391901362_1f82980ffd_t.jpg" style="width: 70px; height: 100px;" /></a>On top of that, I had some car repairs
that needed to be done. My mechanics was right next to Julian and
Sadek's place, so I took the opportunity to stay with them for a few
days and catch up. It was good times like when we all used to work
together.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4527358570/"><img alt="32::AM::99" class="align-left" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4527358570_8d759a0f9a_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 75px;" /></a>At the beginning of March Tara referred me to an IT
position at her company.  It fit my schedule perfectly, and I managed to
land that and get my current sublet on Telegraph Hill for the same
amount of time within a day of each other, so for the past month and a
half I've been back to the daily grind of 9-5 IT work, catching up on
finances and patiently waiting for immigration to contact Tien about
when she will get her K-1 visa interview.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4442844248/"><img alt="Dan Lopez, March 2010" class="align-left" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2794/4442844248_4a9a794e3a_t.jpg" style="width: 62px; height: 100px;" /></a><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4510869105/"><img alt="Hanik" class="align-right" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2406/4510869105_b7d8c109af_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 61px;" /></a>I've had some good social times in
there, but no traveling. In fact, I don't even drive my car anymore
except to move it from one street cleaning zone to another every week or
so. My friend Dan Lopez hired me to photograph him for some media stuff
he had coming up with Linux.com. I finally met up with Hanik, a local
house DJ that my friend Jonathan knows.  SugarCon was this week, so I
caught up with some old friends there, and also happened to run into
Chris Nojima on Market Street.</p>
<p>A few days ago my good friend Rob got hired on at Boxee and will be
moving to New York, so that will surely be a trip I will be taking in
the next year.</p>
<p>I bought an iPad after a lot of back and forth and waiting a few weeks
from its release. I've always loved the tech, and always wanted a
tablet, but aside from that I think it will be very useful on my trip.
It fits my travel needs, which are pretty lightweight compared to what
I do with my laptop, and I can probably sell it in Vietnam for a profit
since they aren't for sale there yet.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4504276125/"><img alt="32::AM::91" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4504276125_43504edd57_t.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 90px;" /></a>At the beginning of the month I had called USCIS about the
status of Tien's visa, and they referred me to the US Consulate in Ho
Chi Minh City. I contacted them via e-mail, their preferred method, but
never heard back. I called them after a week and a half, but they said
they couldn't answer questions over the phone. Luckily Tien is living in
Saigon now, so a few days ago she went down there and discovered that
they had sent her interview letter in February, but it just hadn't
arrived. This was both good and bad. It sucks that we've wasted two
months, but also in that time I've been able to make some money and some
good business contacts.</p>
<p>Today I began shifting back into traveler mode, focusing on what
technology I need to bring on my trip, how to go about packing my
day-to-day things back up, and things of that nature.  I have exactly
two weeks to finish my job and move out of my apartment.</p>
<p>My plan is to travel to Vietnam and see my fiancé who I haven't touched
in 144 days. We'll travel north to Hanoi and Ha Long, and hopefully hit
Danang and Hue on the way back south, then return to her home town to
see her family. I'm thinking we may go to Ha Tien beach, and maybe to
the island of Phu Quoc that we had considered going to last time.</p>
<p>That being said, now that we're back in touch with NVC things could
change, especially if Tien gets her visa interview soon. Either way, I'm
planning to return to my where my girl is and live happily ever after
with her by my side, not 8,000 miles away in a country on the other side
of the planet.</p>
