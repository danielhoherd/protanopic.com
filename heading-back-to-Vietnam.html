		<p>It's been a long time since I've written anything, mainly because I
haven't been traveling. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3988977455/"><img alt="Espiritu del sol" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3470/3988977455_fe21189536_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a>I left Colorado and drove
back to San Francisco in mid August, over two months ago. In that time
I've mainly been focusing on two things: finishing an I-129f petition
for Tien and studying and practicing flash photography. Most of that
time has been spent sleeping on the floor or couch in Brianna, Lily and
Terresina's living room. I did get a sublet for a few weeks right up on
top of twin peaks, and I did stay with some other friend in that time.
Some people had suggested that I get a job and an apartment and prepare
for Tien's arrival in the US, but I just didn't want to do things that
way. Instead, once I finished Tien's petition I decided to go back to
Vietnam. So, here I am on Northwest Airlines flight 27 from San
Francisco to Tokyo where I have a quick layover before flying to Saigon.</p>
<p>Honestly, the last few months have been difficult personally because my
future has been up in the air and it's been up to me to steer the
direction of my life through wide open uncertain circumstances. My
fiance is still in Vietnam and probably can't enter the US for 7 more
months. I've been wading through the US immigration system pretty much
on my own. I have no job and no home of my own. There was the option of
starting up a photography business of my own. For a while I didn't even
have a phone, then I realized that was ridiculous and forked over $70 a
month for an iPhone plan which was extra great because of tethering. I
still don't have health insurance which led to me skipping an optional
vaccination and needing to find malaria meds in VN because I didn't find
the SF Travel Clinic until last night, and I just started planning this
trip 3 days ago.</p>
<p>Two nights ago I took the girls out for dinner as a thank you for being
so hospitable and to have one last great time with them before heading
out. Yesterday I took care of last minute preparations. One of the
things I did was buy a pocket camera to replace the LX3 I had purchased
in Saigon last time. I lost the LX3 at Lovefest after drinking a bit too
much. I honestly have no idea where I lost it, but I was happy I didn't
lose my D300 instead. The camera I picked up was a $150 Samsung NV24HD.
The look is what first caught my eye, then its remarkable interface,
then its ability to do 60fps video and lastly its 24mm equivalent lens.
A few quick googles showed happy owners so I followed the impulse and
bought it. Following impulses is working out pretty good for me.</p>
<p>That night I headed down to Lila's house to crash there for the night.
Will had wrecked one of their cars so like last time I let her them
borrow mine. This works out great because they get a car and i don't
have to pay storage costs. Lila and I took Maks to his new school in
Palo Alto and then she dropped me off at SFO. My friend Blake is living
out in SF now and was flying back to CO for a week, so I met up with him
at the airport after checking in for my flight. We caught up on recent
life details and future life strategy while he waited in an incredibly
long line at the Southwest Airlines ticket counter. I left him still in
it when I had to go to the international area.</p>
<p>At the security checkpoint I was happy to see that they had gotten rid
of that lame requirement to remove your laptop. The posted signs only
said to remove oxygen mask systems, full size DVD players and game
systems, but no mention of laptops anywhere. My happiness at not having
to unpack my bag was ended with a snide comment from a TSA agent about
how I was supposed to remove my laptop for the x-Ray machine. I wished
her luck when she said she was going to take it out for me, but thought
again about how I needed that luck since I'd be the one repacking my
bag. Stupid TSA security theater.</p>
<p>I bought an $8 ham sandwich and a single serving bottle of wine because
I'd need to sleep on the plane. International flights may be one of the
only legitimate excuses for drinking in the morning. I ate, emailed
Tien, canceled my per-month iPhone plan and boarded the plane. We took
off ahead of schedule and are looking at a shorter than expected travel
time. Maybe I'll catch sunset in Tokyo. Hopefully it's not foggy like
last time.</p>
<p>My trip was taking the same route I took last time, SF to Tokyo to
Saigon. Last time I flew on All Nippon Airways and it was absolutely the
best airline experience I've ever had. I had tried to get another flight
with them, but after searching I found that United and NWA (Delta) were
roughly half the cost at $680 round trip. I thought this was a fantastic
deal considering I was buying two days in advance, but then I remembered
the recent flood that ravaged Hoi An and other coastal towns in that
region and it made sense.</p>
<p>Transcontinental flights are already pretty awesome with their in-flight
entertainment systems in each seat, typically more room than domestic
flights and meals and drinks are included in the ticket price. I wasn't
so sure how delta would stack up against Ana and was a little interested
in finding out. 3 hours into my flight I have some results...</p>
<p>The entertainment system for the whole plane crashed shortly after I
started using it. The flight attendant on the intercom said it would
take 15 minutes to reboot, and it did. A sight that was familiar to me
came on the screen: tux the penguin and a bunch of black and white
textual technological jargon.</p>
<p>After a few iterations the system eventually stabilized and I was
allowed the displeasure of finding innumerable bugs and limitations. The
media wasn't sortable and was not listed alphabetically. When browsing
reviews, the &quot;next&quot; function was 4 clicks away while the default was
&quot;watch trailer&quot;, which clearly assumes that people intend to watch
trailers more than skip to the next review. The media was Aldo
incorrectly linked so that clicking Forrest Gump let you watch a
Honduran movie called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1127715/">Sin
Nombre</a>. There were 4 unhelpful
listings for Delta TV that ended up being popular american television
shows. The most disheartening thing was their lack of selection, there
are only a handful of movies available, nothing for me to watch. The
in-flight map showed that we had flown 8500 or so miles shortly after
takeoff. This was accompanied by a flat map, not a globe. The &quot;comments&quot;
link only let you take a survey and not actually leave comments, which
stiles one my personal pet peeves of interface elements that say they do
one thing and do something completely different. &quot;Download now&quot; is the
worst offense of this kind on the Internet. So, yeah, big fail on the
delta entertainment system unless the label it as alpha or maybe beta.</p>
<p>The next test was the meal. It was actually very good, but plastic
silverware is wasteful and cheap. They did provide hand towels, coffee,
beer and wine though, so that was also nice. All in all, not too bad.</p>
<p>One of the highlights o this trip is meeting up with an old room mate
and coworker, David Tran. He's a Vietnamese Parisian who is on a trip to
Saigon to see his family. he's actually in Singapore right now but will
be returning on Monday which gives Tien and I some time to spend in
Saigon with each other and her friend Trinh and gives me time to adjust
to the time difference, find malarone and get started on that two day
lead in before entering malaria infested areas.</p>
