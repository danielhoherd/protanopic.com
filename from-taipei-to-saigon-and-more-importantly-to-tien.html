		<p>On the flight to Saigon I sat next to a nice Vietnamese man from Canada
who was going home to visit family. We didn't talk a whole lot, but he
did mention that Saigon is different every time he goes back, always
expanding and always building. He'd grown up in Saigon but had been
living in Canada for over 20 years, which means he'd seen quite a lot
changes.</p>
<p>The flight had the standard in-flight entertainment systems on the back
of each chair, and I watched people trying to touch the screens as if
they were interactive. Then, miraculously they were interactive. They
were so slow to respond it was hardly usable, and you couldn't do
gestures like so many people were trying, but you could in fact touch
things. This made up for some of my gripes about this system from my
travels last year.</p>
<p>When we landed and gathered our things, waiting for those ahead of us to
deplane, the man next to me laughed, opened up a plastic bag he was
carrying and pulled out a whopper hamburger. He said he had 9 more in
the bag that he brought for his family.</p>
<p>I had arranged for a landing visa when my landlord Brando from my place
on Telegraph Hill had suggested it to me. He said it was quicker and
cheaper. It was cheaper, and significantly easier, but because there
were so many other people waiting for them it didn't necessarily end up
being quicker. It wasn't the longest I'd had to wait to enter a country
though, so I certainly couldn't complain.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4608238090/"><img alt="32::AM::121 - Tien in the back of a Saigon Taxi" class="align-right" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1339/4608238090_abc53cf007_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a>After about 45
minutes of waiting I finally made it into the country, fetched my box of
gifts and passed through customs without a hitch. I saw Tien before I
even made it outside. She was standing in a crowd beyond a glass wall
looking beautiful in a black skirt with a bouquet of roses. She spotted
me and waved, motioned and ran off through the crowd to get to the
fenced area where arrivals are greeted by their loved ones. I set my
things down and picked her up in a huge embrace, happy to be back
together after more than five months apart. Mai was also there waiting
with her, and the three of us caught a taxi back to the Ruby Star. We
relaxed for a while and ate some chocolate that I'd brought, then went
out for lunch at a place a few doors down that Tien and I had seen but
never eaten.</p>
<p>Mai headed home after lunch, and Tien and I spent the rest of the
afternoon catching up with lost time and napping. We had dinner and went
for a walk through the heart of Pham Ngu Lao. We heard mexican music
playing in the park where some people were dancing, and a few other live
bands playing english songs, which could've been awesome if I'd been
gone longer.</p>
