		<p>While the tragic mystery of my corrupt hard disk was unfolding I made
progress with other technology. A new version of Blackra1n had come out
that allowed me to upgrade my iPhone from 3.0.1 to 3.1.2 and jailbreak
it. This was the simplest iPhone jailbreak ever and had the option to
only do the network unlock and not install other low level tools or app
installers. Getting to 3.1x was good because there are some useful apps
that don't run on older versions, like
<a class="reference external" href="getdropbox.com/referrals/NTIwNTUwNjA5">Dropbox</a>. Yelp also doesn't
run on older versions, but that's not helpful outside of
America.<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4079878969/"><img alt="Night Sounds from Hell" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/4079878969_fb123828b0_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a></p>
<p>Tien and I went for another walk to find a screwdriver and some dinner.
We tracked down a screwdriver with little problem and on the way back to
the restaurant we found a doughnut shop. Regular people do not eat
doughnuts before dinner, but Tien had never had a doughnut before so we
indulged and bought six. We walked down the street and shared three of
them on the way to dinner.</p>
<p>We chose Viva Coffee for dinner and got a table on the upstairs patio.
During this stay in Saigon we ended up eating there quite a bit no only
because most of our other outings to find decent restaurants came up
fruitless, but because it was literally 2 skinny VN doors down from our
hotel.</p>
<p>We had only ever sat downstairs outside, and as we made our way through
the inside and upstairs we found that the rest of the cafe was quite
different. Outside was decent patio furniture and glass tables with
trees that had colored lights hanging from the branches. There were
large reaching awnings that could be set nearby your table to give you
cover if you needed it. Inside there were rooms with bright colors under
dim light with couches set around central coffee tables. The stairs
going up were zebra print. There were large screen TVs everywhere
playing various asian and American movies. There was even a large TV
outside where we were going and at first nobody was there to watch it.</p>
<p>We ordered dinner and I had a cocktail. The cocktails in Asia are never,
ever as good as they are in America. Most aren't even close to the same
taste, and sometimes they're flat out wrong. I had been making my way
through the cocktail list trying to find anything that was made right,
but this last night turned out to be no victorious climax as I was
served a Sex on the Beach with a cherry, a pineapple and a little straw
hat as garnish. Not even close. Fortunately it still tasted decent,
whatever it was.</p>
<p>Tien and I talked about differences again, mostly differences in
freedom. I explained again how Americans have rights that we believe
that every person should have by default, not because of some exception
or allowance in the law that says it's OK, but because it's a right that
should never be taken away. Free speech, freedom of religion, the right
to bare arms, etc.. The freedom of speech was a big point. She kept
asking me if there was anything an American could say that would get
them in trouble. I told her there really wasn't, we were free to say
whatever we like. We could bad mouth the government, the police, the
president, whoever we want that we disagree with. If you got in trouble
it was because of the circumstances surrounding what you said or it was
unjust. She thought this was amazing because, of course, she's from
Vietnam where they say you can say what you want but then they don't let
you say anything contrary to popular thought or anti-government or
revolutionary. The VN government is even giving buddhist monks a hard
time because they see even such a passive religion as competition to the
leadership of the government.</p>
<p>We also talked a lot about gun ownership and how that is a dividing
issue in America. Tien said she's really scared of guns and she thinks
that Americans always want to shoot and kill each other because that's
what's on TV and in the movies. Obviously she doesn't think American
life is really like the movies, but to what extent it is different she
does not know. I explained both sides of the argument and then went into
detail about my perspective on the issue, that we should be allowed to
own guns in order to protect ourselves from intruders and as principle
to keep oppressors in check.</p>
<p>While we were chatting and eating I checked my phone and saw that my
brother had posted a Facebook update. After 4 years in the Army,
including two tours in Iraq as a combat medic, he was once again a
civilian.</p>
