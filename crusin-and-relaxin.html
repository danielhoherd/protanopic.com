		<p>Today I was planning on taking part of the morning to check online for
options to go to Ha Long bay and to call Igor to ask him about some
comments he left concerning traveling Laos and Cambodia. Before doing
that we had a somewhat American breakfast with eggs and bread, but with
the addition of peppered soy sauce, radish and cucumber. It was really
freakin good, you should try it. It was raining pretty heavy and before
I could go online the power went out in all of Binh Hoa, which Tien said
is pretty uncommon. The rain stopped but the power was still out. Tien
and I decided to go cruise around the and take photos so we mounted up
on her scooter and headed down the tiny streets of her village. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3594306839/"><img alt="Foot Bridge in Binh Hoa" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3594306839_886de55dc1_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> When I say tiny, I mean about maybe 8-10 feet wide
for two-way traffic. Smaller than the sidewalks on Market Street in San
Francisco. I got to photograph the cool foot-bridge style bridges that
people ride over the rivers, and actually got off the scooter to
photograph some stuff. That's awesome because it's so hard to photograph
things from a scooter not only because things are flying by, but because
your brain composites the pieces of information that your eyes take in
and makes it appear like you have a better view than you actually do,
and the truth about this shows up in a photograph.</p>
<p>When we got home there was a terrible smell in the house, which I
thought might be due to spoiled food, but was actually some pigs that
the neighbors decided to let out in their back yard. I never got the
whole story on that, but we ended up sitting in the front room fanning
ourselves for a while until somebody filled the house with perfume and
we came inside to eat fruit and try to stay cool. Most of us ended up
napping, me in a hammock in the living room and Tien on the couch,
taking turns fanning each other. Torrential rain came back and cooled
everything down, which was nice, then Tien and I laid around some more
listening to music off my iPod. I really wish I could've gotten photos
of it because it's totally the kind of thing I'd love to photograph, but
that's the problem with experiencing things first person. The power came
back on, but now it's like 1am in San Francisco so I can't call Igor
yet. Oh well, it's not like I'm in a rush to get anywhere.</p>

<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/3597517272/"><img alt="Geckos on the wall" class="align-right" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3663/3597517272_fed2da2aca_t.jpg" style="width: 66px; height: 100px;" /></a> A gecko just ran across the floor. This is
remarkable not because it's a gecko and it's inside, but because it's on
the floor. There are tons of geckos all over the walls. They chirp at
night and sometimes wake me up. They eat bugs, so that's good. Nobody
even pays attention to them except me. I asked Tien if she'd ever caught
one and she said no, and she was totally unaware that if you catch one
and pet its belly it will fall asleep. Maybe I should catch one and show
everybody how it's done.</p>
