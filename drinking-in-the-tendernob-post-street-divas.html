		<p>After getting back from Santa Cruz, Brianna was the only one home at
4211. Shannon and Lily were already well into their evening somewhere
out in the city and I was pretty late meeting up with them. Brianna
decided to go out, so we got in the car and headed to Mission.</p>
<p>The problems were these... I couldn't get in touch with either Shannon
or Lily, and Brianna just flat out didn't want to go to this thing she
was supposed to go to. At the venue, she decided to go my way instead
and we ended up driving around Soma for a while trying to come up with
something enjoyable to do on minimal energy and money. During our nearly
fruitless brainstorming I finally got in touch with Shannon who told us
where to go, and where to go was a pretty shady neighborhood...</p>
<p>After 30 minutes of looking for parking, Brianna and I made our way up
to within a block of the bar before I asked her if she'd locked her
door, then we went back to the car and thought this through... See, the
neighborhood we were in was not exactly a great place. There were
junkies and cops pretty much everywhere. On top of that, I think that on
our walk we found the epicenter of transvestite culture in San
Francisco. Post and Polk is home to Diva's. I can't tell you much about
the bar since we didn't go inside, but judging by the fake tits and
adam's apples in mini skirts and stiletto's outside, I got a pretty
accurate picture of what to expect. Brianna got a gracious compliment,
&quot;she doesn't even look like a man&quot;, though it could've been simply about
her beauty, or that we were not recovering from addiction.</p>
<p>We decided to go back to the bar and at least have one drink. On the way
we passed a junkie clinic where a man saw me walking with Brianna and
said frankly &quot;you're a lucky man.&quot; I can only imagine he had an unspoken
&quot;because she's actually a girl&quot; on the end of that statement.</p>
<p>The place we were going, Cafe Royale, was actually an awesome bar more
towards the less deviant end of the street. We finally met up with
Shannon, Lily and Scott and had a few good drinks, good laughs, and
generally had a great time. A few hours later the girls piled into my
car and headed back to 4211.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the girls are doing Bay to Breakers, as are about 100,000 other
people. I'm not, though, since crowds that big really don't do it for
me. I'm not sure what I'll do, but I plan to head down to Lila's house
in the afternoon and perhaps take her Ducati out for a spin...</p>
<p>I just realized I didn't take any photos tonight. I really ought to pick
up a pocket camera to keep this a photo blog and not just a blog.</p>
