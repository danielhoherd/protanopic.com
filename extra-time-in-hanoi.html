		<p>Since we had bought our tickets for June 2nd, June 1st was an open day
to do anything. We spent the morning being lazy but eventually made it
out to enjoy the city. <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4671091824/"><img alt="32::AM::143" class="align-right" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4671091824_aacc885614_m.jpg" style="width: 159px; height: 240px;" /></a>We found no shortage of camera
shops, which was great because a lot of them had vintage gear that was
neat to see. I stopped into one and priced an SD card to help me hack
the Wii, and ended up going back for it later when I found out it was
the best deal.</p>
<p>We strolled down to the cafe by the lake that we'd eaten at last time we
were in Hanoi. Its &quot;The Quintessence of Hanoian&quot;, though I can't
remember the name. The cafe is nice but there's no internet, which kinda
sucks, especially when there's an e-mail waiting in your inbox that
tells you that your flight on the next morning has been canceled and
you've been put on a flight later that evening. I got that e-mail when
we eventually found internet elsewhere, but it was too late to check out
of our hotel that day even if we could get on a flight that evening, so
we stayed. We did call them on the phone to plea with them to
reconsider, but the best they could do was put us on a flight at 8pm,
not 9pm. So much for arriving home at a decent hour.</p>
<p>That evening we decided to check out a western restaurant. I had seen it
while we were walking around and decided to check it out to get away
from the continual asian selections we were surviving on. This night I
got pizza, nachos, and sangria, and Tien got honey chicken. None of it
was the best I'd had, but it was delicious and welcome to my taste buds.</p>
<p>After dinner we went down to the lake to watch the sun set. We missed
the most beautiful parts of it, but it was still nice and we sat down
there for a while taking photos and just watching the world. Just before
we left, power flickered on and off in a large part of the city, and
when we got back to our neighborhood the power was out on the entire
block. Tien didn't want to go into the hotel because it was dark and
scary and probably too hot, but I wanted to make it to our air
conditioned room. Sure the power was out, but it hadn't been all night,
and the room was probably nice and cool. In fact, the room was nice and
cool, and the power came on just after we found our way up the candle
lit stairwell and into the room.</p>
