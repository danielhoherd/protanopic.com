		<p>On May 24th Tien and I woke up with a plan to head to Saigon. We booked
a bus for 3pm and spent the morning playing more Wii and PvZ. We played
PvZ all the way until the bus to Saigon was right outside Thu's house
honking its horn waiting for us to get onboard. We got on and headed
straight away, getting across the My Thuan Bridge in only 2 hours and 15
minutes.</p>
<p>As we were crossing the bridge the Kid Koala remix of Moon River came
on, and I began to miss 4211 Moraga. I first saw the movie Breakfast at
Tiffany's when I was living there, and I remember thinking that it was
the most accurate example of how the parties at 4211 would go. Full
house, people dressed up, climbing in and out of windows onto the fire
escape, etc.. I really loved living there, I think we had something that
not many people find in their life, and it was great. This week, a year
after everybody else moved off the block, Lauren is finally moving away.</p>
<p>We stopped for a snack and then drove on towards Saigon. Night fell and
I put on The Kleptones 24 Hours album. I looked out the window and found
it hard to tell that I was in Vietnam. Between the mashup music and
samples transporting my mind to somewhere in the Western pop culture
ethos, the landscape was also changing. We found ourselves on a highway
like no other highway I'd been on in Vietnam. It was raised up on a berm
with a view out over the dark trees and neighborhoods. There were even
green markers with white numbers ticking away the km. It was a smooth
highway, and there were no motorbikes allowed here. It felt like we were
in the midwest of the USA.</p>
<p>It was also an extremely efficient way to get to Saigon, as we got there
in about 4.5 hours, which is less than any other trip we'd taken. We
ended up at the same bus station on some back road of District 5 as when
I had left Vietnam last November. It's essentially a garage on a dirty
side road off a main street. I think we even took the same van to get to
the hotel that we took last November to the airport. We checked into a
room on the 7th floor of the Bui Phan Hotel and went next door to Viva
Coffee for dinner, then retired. We had an early morning at the
consulate to look forward to.</p>
<p>We got up early on May 25, got breakfast and tried to find a motorbike
to rent. Nobody would rent us one though since we didn't have our
passports since they were at the hotel front desk. We had planned to
take a motorbike to the consulate, but ended up settling on a taxi since
we ran out of time before finding a moto.</p>
<p>We first went to a service that Tien's sister had hired for her to help
handle the consulate procedures. I sat and played Angry Birds on my
iPhone and waited there while Tien went to get a letter from the
consulate that would tell her when her interview date was. This was a
significant piece of information, a huge puzzle piece in the nebulous,
infinite maze of US immigration procedures.</p>
<p>And of course they didn't give it to her. It can never be easy with
immigration.</p>
<p>They apparently needed her to have a different address. Why on earth it
makes such a big deal which address they have on file, I will never
know. It is probably the same illogical reasons that banks use when they
require you to have a physical address on file instead of a PO box, even
when you don't have a permanent physical address. They'd rather have
inaccurate info that fits within their broken rules than accurate
information that doesn't apply to hoi polloi.</p>
<p>So, I went down to the consulate and stood in line. While I was waiting
a security guard walked directly over to me and asked me if he could
help me with anything. I don't know why he picked me out of the whole
crowd, maybe he didn't like my looks or maybe I was unknowingly giving
him a threatening look. I told him my business and he walked away.</p>
<p>When I got to the window where you can ask information and asked them
for the date of Tien's interview they said they would not give it to me.
They needed updated address information for her file. It's just so
fucking important that they know where you *say* you live even if you
don't spend most of your time there. So, so, so fucking important. And
that got me really fucking frustrated. Dealing with immigration is the
most painful, frustrating thing I've had to deal with in I can't
remember how long, perhaps my whole life. It makes me livid.</p>
<p>We went back to the service, Tien talked to them while I sat there and
steamed, we got a piece of fucking paper with some words on it, walked
down to the consulate and they gave us the info just like that. I
should've been really happy, but actually I was just really fucking
pissed off at how asinine this whole damn situation is. They *really*
needed her address updated that badly? It's not like they know how to
send letters anyway, none of the shit they sent us ever arrived at her
cousin's house when she was living there. What makes us think that if
they can't successfully send mail across the fucking city that a letter
will ever arrive in a tiny farming village in another province near the
Cambodian border? WTF ever, they got their info and we got ours. It was
an intel hostage exchange that we had successfully negotiated by
complying with the perpetrators every demands.</p>
<p>June 16th.</p>
<p>Tien would have her interview on June 16th, and if she passed it she
would get her visa to go to America to marry me on the 17th. This meant
we could be back in America by the end of June. I thought about this and
tried to focus on the happy things in the taxi back to the hotel.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/4641443905/"><img alt="32::AM::136" class="align-left" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3347/4641443905_6a0001ebe2_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /></a>We took a nap during the mid day heat, then went
downstairs and rented a moto from our hotel. This was an idea that we
hadn't really thought of before, but I remembered our ease in renting a
bike in Da Lat and got the idea from that. We cruised down to Highlands
Coffee for lunch, then went back to the consulate to get the official
letter that should've arrived at Tien's cousin's house however long ago
they sent it.</p>
<p>After that we just cruised the city, at first because we got lost and
then after we found our way we just wanted to keep cruising and see some
sights. It was the first time we'd had a bike in Saigon. Tien had one
while she was living here, but never while I was around. Before
returning to the hotel we went and bought some plane tickets to Hanoi,
some doughnuts and some sugar cane juice. We took them back to the hotel
and watched Avatar on my laptop.</p>
<p>We lazed away the morning of May 26, spending a lot of time online in
our air conditioned hotel room. My brother was online and he told me
that my dad had almost died while choking on a chicken bone. He had
passed out and gashed his head on the way to the floor, home all alone.
He woke up covered in blood and called for help. My mom was with him at
the hospital and he was doing decent, alive and stable and probably not
permanently damaged. My brother and I decided to buy him a helmet since
he seems to be making a habit of this kind of thing, having done
something similar last Christmas.</p>
<p>Tien and I caught a taxi to the airport. That taxi hit a motorbike on
the way there. Just gently though, and the driver bitched loudly as he
rode off with his passenger. I wondered how Saigon would handle the
influx of cars that would undoubtedly come with its current business
expansions.</p>
<p>At the airport there were two girls talking in castilian spanish sitting
behind us in the waiting area. The Jetstar flight to Hanoi was
unremarkable, other than the fact that it was Tien's third time flying.
She did well.</p>
<p>I got an aisle seat in the bus from the airport to downtown, and aisle
seats always suck. My shoulders are too broad and everybody hits them
with their hips as they walk by.</p>
<p>This was Tien's first time in Hanoi and I wondered what she thought of
it as I recalled my last trip and took in the differences between the
north and south. Things are more ornate up here. There is more dirt and
more rocks. Most highways are raised up on berms or on bridges, and
there are significantly more cars. The traffic didn't flow nearly as
well as it did in Saigon, and it was because of the higher number of
cars. One car could be stopped and it would back up the whole flow,
whereas in Saigon the motos just go around. Another thing I noticed was
that people would drive their cars like motorbikes, driving into
oncoming traffic on the wrong side of the street, as if they could just
slip by oncoming traffic as easily as they could on a motorbike. Traffic
here would prove to be much more frustrating and less fluid than that in
Saigon.</p>
<p>At the bus stop a man with a taxi offered to take us to his hotel. It
was nearby where we wanted to stay so we went. We agreed to stay there,
but the more I looked at things the more I realized we'd checked into a
pretty crummy hotel. Not only that but after walking around our
neighborhood we realized that it kinda sucked. Those two factors made
Hanoi much less fun than I was hoping.</p>
<p>We went out for dinner and found something just as mediocre as our
hotel, ate, then retired for the night.</p>
