		<p>Having arrived late to Vientiane and taken the first guesthouse with an
opening, Thursday morning I went to find a better option, an option with
Internet. That is vital if you want to stay in touch with people who are
scattered around the globe.</p>
<p>I checked into a nice looking guesthouse with a huge bed in a pretty
good looking room. I signed on to catch up with photos and whatnot and
discovered that even though there was wifi, the actual Internet
connection was glacial. It was reminiscent of the 14.4 days. Facebook
took over 15 minutes to load. Ping times to google were Averaging 5000ms
over 20 hops with 8% packet loss and an MTU of 1100. This was
terrible...</p>
<p>On top of that, as the day warmed up there began a breeze that crept in
through the window leading out to the tiny alley, bringing with it a
pungent aroma of pestilence.</p>
<p>It was mid day so I left the stench and went for a walk. Just as I was
photographing some stuff and fearing getting rained on a nice tuk tuk
driver came up and offered to take me to some local sites that were
photogenic. He had photos of the places and they were indeed grand so I
agreed and jumped in the back of his tuk tuk. Off we went, the tuk tuk
bumping and whining all the way.</p>
<p>The clouds went away without raining and left a hot, humid day. The
skies were beautiful blue with an assortment of scattered clouds. I was
soon drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>We saw four locations and miraculously ended up by my hotel. I went
inside to clean up and cool off, then went to find dinner. I also had to
figure out what to do in Laos.</p>
<p>I found a restaurant where some kid on the way out said the food was good
and ended up being wrong.  Soon after sitting down a local girl started
talking to me and invited me to sit with her. I obliged but soon
regretted it. She could barely speak conversational English, seemed
mentally vacant and just wanted to go to a bar. Soon after sitting down
a man came by and offered me Viagra. I paid for my food and left.</p>
<p>I did go to a bar though. I had a delicious cocktail and chatted with
some backpackers from the UK. They suggested that I go to Veng Viang and
showed me photos from the previous day. It was gorgeous and I thought
that I'd like to go. Then they said it was a party town and I thought
twice. It was gorgeous though...</p>
<p>I had been in Asia for a month so far and was finally getting a bit
tired of traveling. I'm not sure if it was loneliness or exhaustion, but
it was probably a bit of both. I was tired of having to look so far past
the defacto tourist bullshit to find things actually worth doing.
Photographing Veng Viang was definitely worth doing, but in the end I
decided to fly back to Vietnam to be with Tien and go to Vung Tau beach,
something we had wanted to do previously but were unable to do. I was a
little bummed about not getting to spend more time in Laos, but the
world has a lot to see and I can always come back.</p>
<p>The next day I checked out of the stinky slow internet room and went to
secure my airfare to Vietnam. I couldn't get a ticket for that same day
so I got one for Saturday and went to find my third hotel in Vientiane.
This was half the price of the last, had a window looking across a
street to a temple and had no Internet. There was an Internet cafe right
next door though.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/warzauwynn/6020772190/"><img alt="Third Hotel" class="align-left" src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6138/6020772190_4bc2647826_n.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 159px;" /></a> To access the Internet you were supposed to go buy an access card, then
log into their web portal and enter the info to get access. I really
didn't feel like leaving my hotel room and took this as another claw
sharpening tech challenge. Within a few minutes I'd found an open HTTP
proxy within their network and used it to get online. The access was
much much faster than my previous accommodations but had limitations on
allowed protocols. It was fine for my needs and I spent the next few
hours trying to circumvent the protocol limitations. I never got
anywhere with it, but it was a good exercise and it was good to know
that my skills hadn't dulled in the last month of unemployment.</p>
<p>I got hungry so I went back to the full moon cafe where I'd met the UK
backpackers. This place was a branch of the Cambodian Boom Boom Room, a
media store specializing in the illicit sale of music and movies to
travelers at terribly low prices. One album was $1.50. I bought 5.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel there was smoke in the air as the monks across the
street burned leaves they had raked up. This morning, July 4th, they
woke me up with drumming and chanting. I think monks may not be great
neighbors.</p>
<p>After a delicious breakfast I checked out, found a tuk tuk and headed
for the airport. My short stay I Laos is pretty much over, save waiting
for my currently delayed flight. I like it here though and I'd like to
come back some day and go farther in. Today though it's airplanes, my
girl, a hydrofoil and a beach.</p>
